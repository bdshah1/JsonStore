      "Title": "Blackberry announces DETK50, a secure US$299 Android phone  999999999999",
      "Body": "BlackBerry's first Android phone, the Priv , wasn't half bad. It just didn't offer enough to justify that $700 price. If you were enticed by the security features of the Priv, but you don't want to spend that kind of money (and don't need a physical keyboard), you're in luck. The company just announced its second Android phone, and it only costs $299. The DTEK50 (doesn't that name just roll off the tongue?) appears to be a barely-modified Alcatel Idol 4 . The only hardware change seems to be a new backplate that bears the Blackberry logo. It has a 5.2-inch 1080p display, Snapdragon 617 processor, 13MP rear-facing and 8MP front-facing cameras, and 2610 mAh battery. You'll find 3GB of RAM, 16GB of flash storage, and SD card support. Note that the phone isn't based off the superior Idol 4S, which has a higher-res display, larger battery, and better camera. On the software side, BlackBerry has added its own special sauce to improve security and privacy. The company claims it's \"the world's most secure Android phone,\" though that claim doesn't appear to be qualified by an independent authority. In its press release, BlackBerry lists the following features as evidence of the phone's hardened security: Rapid Security Patching: BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK by BlackBerry App: Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also tracks applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust: BlackBerry's manufacturing process uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of DTEK50. Secure Boot Process: Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK50's secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening : BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improved random number, address space generation and certificate pinning to make it more difficult for attackers to target a device by scrambling application/system memory. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption : Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. The phone is up for preorder now on BlackBerry.com, in a bundle with an external battery pack for $299. It will go on sale in retail around August 8th. The story behind the story: Once a mobile powerhouse, BlackBerry has fallen on hard times. The Priv was supposed to turn the company around, but suffered poor sales. By taking an existing design and focusing on BlackBerry's strengths in security and manageability, it's able to field a much more affordable option. It's possible that this is the way forward for the company, but I predict the market will shrug off this device as well. BlackBerry may eventually stop making hardware altogether, instead focusing on its expertise in security and device management as a software and services company.

      "Title": "Check out these official videos about the BlackBerry DTEK50",
      "Body": "[embedded content] If you were away from civilization earlier today, you might have missed the big news. BlackBerry has officially introduced its second Android phone, called the BlackBerry DTEK50. DTEK, as you might recall from its inclusion on the BlackBerry Priv , is an app that monitors the safety of your phone. The new DTEK50 also features the app (it would have a weird name otherwise) and BlackBerry insists that it is the most secure Android phone in the world. What it doesn't have is a physical QWERTY keyboard. And as we've been saying now for weeks, it is a rebranded Alcatel Idol 4 . Of course, there are special BlackBerry features found with the DTEK50. One is the virtual QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard learns how you type the more you use it. Adding a suggested word is as simple as a flick of the finger. And gesture controls have you navigating your way around the handset like a fireman heading to a four alarm fire. With the BlackBerry Hub you can put all of your phone calls, email, social media notifications, scheduling alerts and SMS messages in one place. Gesture controls allow you to delete, snooze, flag, file, mute, and mark read/unread. With Instant Action, users can execute the following actions quickly: Making a phone call (phone, dial, call followed by a phone number/contact name) Sending an SMS (sms, message, msg, or text followed by a contact name and message) Sending an email (email, mail followed by a contact name and message) Playing music (play followed by a song, artist, or album name) Opening Google Maps for directions (map) Creating a note (note or memo followed by a title) Creating a task (task or todo followed by a title) BlackBerry Device Search scans your phone for content. And the BlackBerry Convenience Key, found on the right side of the device, can be programmed by you to open your most used app. It is up to you to decide what to do with the button. BlackBerry has released a number of videos about the DTEK50 which you can view by clicking on the video slideshow below. BlackBerry DTEK50 BlackBerry DTEK50 1. BlackBerry Hub 2. Smartphone Interface 3. Legendary Security 4. Keyboard and Typing 5. Using DTEK by BlackBerry source: BlackBerry",

      "Body": "BlackBerry Limited, a global leader in mobile communications, on Tuesday unveiled 'DTEK50TM', the world's most secure Android smartphone, for pre-orders at ShopBlackBerry.com. DTEK50 is BlackBerry's second smartphone powered by Android, following the PRIV. Fully equipped with Android Marshmallow 6.0, DTEK50 combines BlackBerry's unique security, privacy and productivity with the full Android experience in an all-touch design, at a price point that's accessible for consumers and ideal for enterprise fleet deployment. \"We take our customers' privacy seriously. That's why we're proud to have all the security and privacy functionality that's built in our newest Android smartphone. DTEK50 merges the unique security and connectivity features BlackBerry is known for with the rich Android ecosystem,\" said Ralph Pini, chief operating officer and General Manager, Devices, BlackBerry. \"DTEK50 adds to BlackBerry's lineup of secure smartphones, providing choices to our customers with different price points on both BlackBerry 10 and Android platforms.\" Android Security at the Forefront In a recent survey1 of Android smartphone users, BlackBerry found that 50 percent believe their smartphone is only somewhat secure, and what's more, despite data security fears, one in six Android users don't know about Android security patches. \"With an increase in cybercrime on smartphones, people need to recognize that the private details of their lives – where they live, their bank info, pictures of their kids – are at risk on their personal device. You wouldn't leave the doors of your house unlocked at night. Having a smartphone that doesn't take your privacy seriously is the equivalent,\" said David Kleidermacher, chief security officer, BlackBerry. \"It's equally important for businesses to protect their sensitive data from cyberattacks at all points of their mobile environment – from the device to the network and servers.\" DTEK50 was designed to address the security and privacy needs of today's uncompromising Android users. Smartphones are increasingly being targeted for cyberattacks through tactics like malicious apps, scareware notifications and insecure Wi-Fi connections. BlackBerry's Android smartphones, including DTEK50 and PRIV, have unique built-in hardware security. DTEK50 encrypts all users' information, including business critical data and personal data such as pictures, videos and contacts. Malware protection is also built-in along with back-up, wipe and restore capabilities. Additional software provides users with visibility and control over which apps get access to personal info or device features such as the microphone or camera. BlackBerry also delivers security patches on the same day that Google publicly releases information about them, while many popular Android smartphones put the users' private information at risk of being hacked due to slow security updates. Features that make DTEK50 the most secure Android smartphone, include: Rapid Security Patching: BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK(TM) by BlackBerry App: Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also tracks applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust: BlackBerry's manufacturing process uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of DTEK50. Secure Boot Process: Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK50's secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening: BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improved random number, address space generation and certificate pinning to make it more difficult for attackers to target a device by scrambling application/system memory. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption: Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. Ready to Work DTEK50 combines the world's most secure smartphone with BlackBerry's enterprise management solutions to produce a powerful device capable of powering any work day.

      "Title": "Blackberry launching new smartphone with emphasis on beefed up security",
      "Body": "WATERLOO - In a bid to once again make its struggling hardware business profitable, BlackBerry is launching a new smartphone billed as the most secure Android device available. The company says the DTEK50 target audience is \"everyone\" due to the increasing threat that mobile security risks now pose to the public at large. \"We feel that customers today, certainly businesses and consumers, are beginning to understand just how important security is when it comes to their smartphone,\" Alex Thurber, senior vice-president of global device sales, during a Tuesday webcast launch from the company's Waterloo headquarters. Everyone should be aware of security and privacy, he noted, whether they're the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a parent. \"I certainly want my children to have secure devices. I don't want the world looking at what they take pictures of or their emails or their text messages.\" BlackBerry said the DTEK50 has been designed to fend off cyberattacks with features such as built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. In addition, it provides the ability to see and control which apps are allowed access to features like the phone's camera. The new product is also BlackBerry's thinnest and has an on-screen keyboard - not its traditional keyboard. It appears the company has learned from the sales flop of its first Android-powered phone, the Priv. At a cost of $899, it was released late last year at the company's Canadian web store without a carrier contract. At the time, it was the most expensive Android phone on the market. While BlackBerry hasn't disclosed Priv phone sales, its most recent quarterly results released a month ago showed the company sold 500,000 smartphones in total (including the Priv). That's a drop of 100,000 from the previous quarter and 200,000 fewer than two quarters earlier. Thurber said the DTEK50 is priced to be a very broadly-adopted product and will retail for $429. The company says the new phone is currently available for preorder online, with plans to start shipping Aug. 8. \"We're very confident that from a product perspective this will sell very well,\" Thurber said. BlackBerry has faced calls to stop making smartphones because of disappointing sales and instead focus solely on its growing software and security business. Chief executive officer John Chen has so far shown no inclination to get out of the hardware business, having promised earlier this year to release two mid-range, Android-powered phones before the company's fiscal year ends Feb. 28, 2017. Thurber reiterated that commitment, saying BlackBerry will continue to develop and release Android phones, including one in the near future that will have a physical keyboard. \"Yes, one of them will be the iconic physical-keyboard-based device,\" he said. \"So stay tuned, that will be coming shortly.\" The company says it remains committed to supporting its BlackBerry 10 operating system with software updates.",

      "Title": "Money issues...relationship issues...",
      "Body": "Photo: Dreamcatcher by Jodie Nicole It's hard not to beat myself up when I think back to the last week we were together. There were times when I was not at my best, where I shut down or became selfish, where I didn't allow myself to shine, be childish, or even take on an air of whimsical when I knew I normally could or would. But at the same time I was worried about money. My mileage check, a sizable amount that I had planned to use to fund my trip and pay for his birthday treat, had not arrived on time, thus delaying my planned departure time and prompting me to borrow money for the trip. This caused my ex and I got into a little bit of a tiff. I did not want to borrow the money, I figured I'd wait the extra day for my check to arrive and then I'd leave for his place. He didn't like the idea of me leaving so late in the day and thought I should just borrow the money so I could get on the road. In the end, he was right. It turns out that my check was mailed 9 days after it was cut, instead of the customary 1 day, and did not arrive until the day before I came home. Money was probably the biggest wedge between us because it drove up my feelings of resentment. Especially when things he said he bought me never appeared. I wanted the Christmas present he told me that he ordered...then it was on back order...then the retailer wasn't making it anymore...so he canceled the order...and who knows what he did with the money he used to purchase it in the first place. I wanted the Southern gift basket full of little things like grits and sweet tea, that he told me he was putting together..he was going to wait to send it to me when the Christmas present arrived... and then it promptly disappeared. I wanted the little things, nothing big or expensive just...something I didn't buy, that I could take home and show my friends and family. I did get things from him, but I wonder now if receiving these gifts were a little to late, because the lack of trust was itching at the back of my brain. But at the same time I also did get wonderful things, things that have more meaning than anything that's physical in nature. I got a beautiful handmade double dream catcher (that's pictured above) and a pressed penny, from the last bit of money he had on him. I got a ham sandwich picnic at Guntersville's National Park, overlooking the lake. I got orgasms, hugs, kisses, morning Taken 2/20/2016 by @Jodie Nicole giggles, laugher and cuddles. I got inside jokes, patience, and smiles, I got goofy looks, dances, and taken to meet the grandmother and uncle, and to his best friends family Thanksgiving dinner. I was shown some of the most beautiful spots his home state has to offer, and I enjoyed Southern hospitality. I was given all of this and more, but money still tickled the back of my brain, or maybe it was the little inconsistencies. The day he told me about the settlement I cried for joy, the waiting was over, he was coming up here and we could finally start a our life. Granted my financials were extremely tight. Tighter then I let on because I was stubborn and wanted to see him, spend time with him, give him the best birthday ever, like he gave me, but I knew I'd manage, I always did. Plus school was starting, student loans given, and raises at work were soon due to be handed out, everything was looking up for us...or so I thought. Fear is an incredible thing. So isn't money. The power these two commodities have over people is amazing. I understand the power of fear, having been controlled by it before, but I've never really understood the power of money until very recently. I know one of the first things his friends wondered about me, after I came into the picture was, is she after his settlement. This floored me, mainly because I didn't fathom the concept of being with someone for money. I knew it happened, but...it still felt like a strange notion. I wonder now, if he feels that, his settlement was the reason I stayed with him, especially after I asked him for a check. The truth is, I never gave a damn about his settlement. From day one, I asked him to use the money for himself, and he consistently told me that moving up here, to be with me, was him using it for himself. Unfortunately, this also means that him changing his mind about coming up here is also him using his money for himself and thus doing exactly what I asked him to do. My readers may think that my grief is over him not moving up here, and there is some truth to that, but it's only a sliver of the bigger picture. What hurt the most was the fact that he gave up. For months he'd talk about fighting for me, for us, to keep us together, despite the distance. He told me \"we\" were worth the fight and that you'd have a more luck breaking into Fort Knox, then tearing him away from me. But in the end he gave up. He wasn't willing to compromise, to fight, to even try to figure out how we could continue to make this work despite the distance. And do you know what's truly messed up? Apart of me is still fighting for \"us\" crazy as it seems. Or should I say crazy fool that I am. Love n Light, Jodie Nicole",
