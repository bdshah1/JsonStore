claims DTEK50 is \u0027world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone\u0027","Body":"BlackBerry\u0027s new DTEK50 may be the world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone, as the company claims, but there\u0027s no real indication of when it will reach our shores. The DTEK50 is BlackBerry\u0027s second Android-based phone. The first was the PRIV. Customers in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands can pre-order a DTEK50 for US$299. As for Australia, all we\u0027re told is that \"Availability of the smartphone in other channels and countries will be announced at a later date.\" The DTEK50 runs Android Marshmallow 6.0 with BlackBerry\u0027s security enhancements. These include Android hardening, rapid security patching (same day as Google), the DTEK app (monitors OS and app security, including warnings when apps take pictures or videos, activate the microphone on, send a text message, or access contacts or location), secure boot, and FIPS 140-2 compliant full disk encryption. \"We take our customers\u0027 privacy seriously. That\u0027s why we\u0027re excited with all the security and functionality that\u0027s built in our newest Android smartphone. DTEK50 merges the unique security and connectivity features BlackBerry is known for, with the rich Android ecosystem\", said BlackBerry chief operating officer and general manager of devices, Ralph Pini. \"This device adds to BlackBerry\u0027s lineup of secure smartphones, providing choice to our customers with different price points on both, BlackBerry 10 and Android platforms.\" BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher said \"With an increase in cybercrime on smartphones, consumers need to recognise that the private details of their lives - where they live, their bank info, pictures of their kids - are at risk on their personal device. \"You wouldn\u0027t leave the doors of your house unlocked at night. Having a smartphone that doesn\u0027t take your privacy seriously is the equivalent. \"It\u0027s equally important for businesses to protect their sensitive data from cyberattacks at all points of their mobile environment - from the device to the network and servers.\" So DTEK50 includes Android for Work and Google Play for Work, and works with BlackBerry\u0027s enterprise mobility management and secure productivity apps including WatchDox, Good Work, SecuSUITE for Enterprise, BBM Protected for encrypted messaging and BES12. For user convenience, the DTEK50 includes the BlackBerry Hub unified for email, calendar, social and phone calls, and the customisable BlackBerry Convenience Key for quick access to the most used applications and other capabilities. Hardware features include a 5.2in full HD display with oleophobic surface, support for microSD cards up to 2TB, an 8MP front camera and a 13MP rear camera with phase detection auto focus (for instant focussing) and dual-tone LED flash for realistic looking photos in low light.","ArticleSnippet":null,"Source":"OnlineNews","Author":"ITWire | Stephen Withers","Provider":"Moreover","TwitterID":null,"TwitterName":"","TwitterAvatar":null,"TweetIsDeleted":false,"AuthorUrl":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatar":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatarUrl":null,"KloutScore":0,"CustomFields":null,"NumberOfLikes":null,"Outlet":"ITWire","Language":"English","Sentiment":"Positive","ArticleIsRetweet":false,"ProviderArticleId":"27404046436","PostEngageCount":0,"ArticleUniqueID":null,"MultimediaURLs":["http://www.itwire.com/media/k2/items/cache/3b36c7ef58f538a4bde21fe4dd03589a_XS.jpg"],"IsRightToLeft":false,"Multiplicity":false,"NLAFlag":false,"MediaCodes":null,"AudienceSizeCount":null,"AudienceTypeID":null,"AuditRecurrenceID":null,"AudienceType":null,"AuditRecurrence":null,"ExpiresOn":"","Expired":false,"MediaAvailable":false},{"MonitoringPlatformPostID":"0c4!20160727!0c446665-ded3-4023-adb6-e02a4c7d8a8c","MonitoredTopicID":null,"PrefGlobalReferenceName":"Eastern Standard Time","PrefDateFormat":"MM/dd/yyyy","PrefTimeFormat":"h:mmtt","SavedDate":"\/Date(1469612193900)\/","Notes":null,"IsSaved":true,"PostType":2,"SelectedTagIDs":null,"NewTagNames":null,"SourceString":"OnlineNews","SavedDateString":"07/27/2016 Eastern Standard Time","TimestampString":"07/26/2016 Eastern Standard Time","PublishedDateTimeZone":"07/26/2016|09:33|PM|Eastern Standard Time","AudienceSizeCountString":"90,965 Unique Visitors Monthly","ClipTimeRange":"","CriticalMentionsClipID":null,"CriticalMentionsClipStart":null,"CriticalMentionsClipEnd":null,"CriticalMentionsUUID":null,"CriticalMentionsChannelID":null,"CriticalMentionsMinTime":null,"CriticalMentionsMaxTime":null,"ProjectIDNamePairsList":[{"PostID":649881,"ProjectID":58740,"ProjectName":"note2","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true},{"PostID":649881,"ProjectID":58254,"ProjectName":"Amgen Analysts","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true}],"PostID":"649881","Timestamp":"\/Date(1469583180000)\/","Url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=27403962788\u0026p=1lh\u0026v=1\u0026x=WGG6krfShsAds_O-9qKxyg","Title":"Blackberry announces DETK50, a secure US$299 Android phone  999999999999","Body":"BlackBerry\u0027s first Android phone, the Priv , wasn\u0027t half bad. It just didn\u0027t offer enough to justify that $700 price. If you were enticed by the security features of the Priv, but you don\u0027t want to spend that kind of money (and don\u0027t need a physical keyboard), you\u0027re in luck. The company just announced its second Android phone, and it only costs $299. The DTEK50 (doesn\u0027t that name just roll off the tongue?) appears to be a barely-modified Alcatel Idol 4 . The only hardware change seems to be a new backplate that bears the Blackberry logo. It has a 5.2-inch 1080p display, Snapdragon 617 processor, 13MP rear-facing and 8MP front-facing cameras, and 2610 mAh battery. You\u0027ll find 3GB of RAM, 16GB of flash storage, and SD card support. Note that the phone isn\u0027t based off the superior Idol 4S, which has a higher-res display, larger battery, and better camera. On the software side, BlackBerry has added its own special sauce to improve security and privacy. The company claims it\u0027s \"the world\u0027s most secure Android phone,\" though that claim doesn\u0027t appear to be qualified by an independent authority. In its press release, BlackBerry lists the following features as evidence of the phone\u0027s hardened security: Rapid Security Patching: BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK by BlackBerry App: Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also tracks applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust: BlackBerry\u0027s manufacturing process uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of DTEK50. Secure Boot Process: Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK50\u0027s secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening : BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improved random number, address space generation and certificate pinning to make it more difficult for attackers to target a device by scrambling application/system memory. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption : Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. The phone is up for preorder now on BlackBerry.com, in a bundle with an external battery pack for $299. It will go on sale in retail around August 8th. The story behind the story: Once a mobile powerhouse, BlackBerry has fallen on hard times. The Priv was supposed to turn the company around, but suffered poor sales. By taking an existing design and focusing on BlackBerry\u0027s strengths in security and manageability, it\u0027s able to field a much more affordable option. It\u0027s possible that this is the way forward for the company, but I predict the market will shrug off this device as well. BlackBerry may eventually stop making hardware altogether, instead focusing on its expertise in security and device management as a software and services company.

BlackBerry unveiled an Android-based handset on Wednesday, a device that combines Google\u0027s popular software and broad app catalogue with the company\u0027s security and productivity features at a lower price. The faded smartphone pioneer is hoping the DTEK50 will sell in greater numbers than the Priv, its first phone using the Android operating system, which chief executive John Chen has said suffered because of its high price. The company said the touchscreen-only DTEK50 will cost US$299. It will be released this month, though it\u0027s not available in New Zealand yet. Calling the DTEK50 \"the world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone\", BlackBerry said it will alert users if someone is making remote use of its camera or microphone, or accessing the phone\u0027s location information. At its November launch the Priv, which featured a slide out keyboard, cost US$699. The company cut the price of the Priv, while earlier this month it said it would cease production of its Classic handset, which uses its own BlackBerry 10 operating system. A third Android device is expected from BlackBerry in coming months. - Reuters Comments","ArticleSnippet":null,"Source":"OnlineNews","Author":"Dominion Post","Provider":"Moreover","TwitterID":null,"TwitterName":"","TwitterAvatar":null,"TweetIsDeleted":false,"AuthorUrl":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatar":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatarUrl":null,"KloutScore":0,"CustomFields":null,"NumberOfLikes":null,"Outlet":"Dominion Post","Language":"English","Sentiment":"Neutral","ArticleIsRetweet":false,"ProviderArticleId":"27403788980","PostEngageCount":0,"ArticleUniqueID":null,"MultimediaURLs":[],"IsRightToLeft":false,"Multiplicity":false,"NLAFlag":false,"MediaCodes":null,"AudienceSizeCount":2422283,"AudienceTypeID":2,"AuditRecurrenceID":5,"AudienceType":2,"AuditRecurrence":5,"ExpiresOn":"","Expired":false,"MediaAvailable":false},{"MonitoringPlatformPostID":"584!20160727!58478686-a856-434a-9127-659c5f1de140","MonitoredTopicID":null,"PrefGlobalReferenceName":"Eastern Standard Time","PrefDateFormat":"MM/dd/yyyy","PrefTimeFormat":"h:mmtt","SavedDate":"\/Date(1469612193900)\/","Notes":null,"IsSaved":true,"PostType":null,"SelectedTagIDs":null,"NewTagNames":null,"SourceString":"OnlineNews","SavedDateString":"07/27/2016 Eastern Standard Time","TimestampString":"07/26/2016 Eastern Standard Time","PublishedDateTimeZone":"07/26/2016|09:07|PM|Eastern Standard Time","AudienceSizeCountString":"","ClipTimeRange":"","CriticalMentionsClipID":null,"CriticalMentionsClipStart":null,"CriticalMentionsClipEnd":null,"CriticalMentionsUUID":null,"CriticalMentionsChannelID":null,"CriticalMentionsMinTime":null,"CriticalMentionsMaxTime":null,"ProjectIDNamePairsList":[{"PostID":649885,"ProjectID":58740,"ProjectName":"note2","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true},{"PostID":649885,"ProjectID":58254,"ProjectName":"Amgen Analysts","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true}],"PostID":"649885","Timestamp":"\/Date(1469581620000)\/","Url":"http://www.enterprise-security-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=102590","Title":"BlackBerry Unveils \u0027World\u0027s Most Secure Android Smartphone\u0027","Body":"Priced considerably lower than BlackBerry\u0027s first Android phone, the new DTEK50 is being touted by the Canadian firm as \"the world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone.\" Available for pre-ordering today, the $299 DTEK50 is set to ship on August 8.

The company announced the launch Tuesday of the DTEK50, a phone it hopes will appeal to \"everyone\" due to the insidious threat that mobile security risks now pose to the public at large. \"We feel that customers today, certainly businesses and consumers, are beginning to understand just how important security is when it comes to their smartphone,\" said Alex Thurber, senior vice-president of global device sales, during a webcast from BlackBerry\u0027s headquarters in Waterloo, Ont. Everyone should be aware of security and privacy, whether they\u0027re the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a parent, he said. \"I certainly want my children to have secure devices. I don\u0027t want the world looking at what they take pictures of or their emails or their text messages.\" BlackBerry (TSX:BB) said the DTEK50 has been designed to fend off cyberattacks with features such as built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. In addition, it provides the ability to see and control which apps are allowed access to features like the phone\u0027s camera. The new product is also BlackBerry\u0027s thinnest and has an on-screen keyboard _ not its traditional keyboard. The DTEK50 will retail for C$429, a sign that the company may have learned from the sales flop of its first Android-powered phone, the Priv. At a cost of C$899 without a carrier contract, the Priv was released late last year and at the time, it was the most expensive Android phone on the market. While BlackBerry hasn\u0027t disclosed Priv phone sales, its most recent quarterly results released a month ago showed the company sold 500,000 smartphones in total (including the Priv). That\u0027s a drop of 100,000 over the previous quarter and 200,000 fewer than two quarters earlier. \"We\u0027re very confident that from a product perspective this will sell very well,\" Thurber said of the DTEK50. But that price likely won\u0027t be enough to win over a large number of customers, said Detlev Zwick, an associate professor of marketing at York University\u0027s Schulich School of Business. They will ask themselves what makes the DTEK50 different from other phones in the same price range, and while the answer may be its stronger security measures, that may not be enough to sway them, he said. \"I think most consumers in that price range simply don\u0027t care much about that,\" he said. Instead, they\u0027re more concerned with how user-friendly an interface is, how fun applications are and how quickly they can access their Facebook friends, Zwick said. \"If they really want to change momentum, BlackBerry would need a hit with a handset,\" he continued. \"This is not it.\" BlackBerry has faced calls to stop making smartphones because of disappointing sales and instead focus solely on its growing software and security business. CEO John Chen has so far shown no inclination to heed those calls, having promised earlier this year to release two mid-range, Android-powered phones before the company\u0027s fiscal year ends Feb. 28, 2017. Thurber reiterated that commitment, saying BlackBerry will continue to develop and release Android phones, including one in the near future that will have a physical keyboard. The DTEK50 is available for pre-order online, with plans to start shipping Aug. 8.

The chain, which is based in San Francisco but owned by Intercontinental Hotels Group, said that it was recently made aware of unauthorized charges on cards used at its hotels. It\u0027s unclear how many people or which of its 62 hotels were affected. \"We recommend that individuals closely monitor their payment card account statements,\" a spokeswoman said in an email. \"If there are unauthorized charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank.\" Brian Krebs, who runs the security news site KrebsOnSecurity, initially reported the possible breach. Earnings Gilead shares fall on outlook Gilead Sciences fell the most in almost three months after the company cut its product sales forecast for 2016 and reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales for its hepatitis C drugs. Shares of Foster City\u0027s Gilead fell 8.5 percent to close at $81.05 Tuesday. The drop came in the wake of the biotech company\u0027s earnings report Monday. Although profit topped analysts\u0027 estimates, the company\u0027s outlook disappointed Wall Street. Net product sales will be $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion for the year, it said, down from a previous outlook of $30 billion to $31 billion. The company also expects to spend more on research and development this year. The drugmaker\u0027s hepatitis C pills, Sovaldi and Harvoni, brought in $3.92 billion, missing the $4.06 billion average of projections. Smartphones Security focus for BlackBerry BlackBerry unveiled its latest smartphone, a security-focused touch-screen Android device that it hopes will make the company\u0027s money-losing handset business profitable. At $299, the DTEK50 is priced for midmarket users, cutting in half the original retail cost of BlackBerry\u0027s first Android phone, the Priv, which the company admits was too expensive to appeal to a broad audience. Advance orders are being accepted for the DTEK50 in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, BlackBerry said Tuesday. The DTEK50 is designed for people who demand a stronger sense of security with their mobile phones, either because they fear for their privacy in a world of hackers and data leaks or because their employers require it. Restaurants Zagat revamps ratings in guide Zagat, the restaurant guide known for including quotes from customers, is getting rid of its classic 30-point rating scale in favor of a more streamlined system that will incorporate Google Maps and Search into a redesigned, more personal mobile app. From now on, reviews will be based on a five-tier system, ranking restaurants on a scale from \"poor\" to \"perfection,\" instead of asking diners to differentiate between a rating of 21 or 22 in multiple categories. The new app, which will be available first on Apple\u0027s iOS, will have a sleeker design that reflects the sparse simplicity of Google, which bought the dining guide in 2011 for $151 million. The changes will also put Zagat in line with competing digital reviewers like Yelp and TripAdvisor. \"We thought it was time to cook up an update to our iOS app to provide our foodie fans with the freshest, most relevant content — while on the go,\" according to a Zagat blog post Tuesday. The guide started in New York as a newsletter more than 35 years ago. Economy Mixed feelings by consumers American consumers are feeling confident about current economic conditions but are a bit warier about the future. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index was essentially unchanged in July, dipping to 97.3 from a revised 97.4 in June. The business group\u0027s index includes consumers\u0027 assessment of the economy now and what they expect over the next six months. Their view of today\u0027s economy rose to the highest level since September, but their outlook slipped. The survey was the first to measure sentiment since Britain voted June 23 to leave the European Union. That vote rattled financial markets but doesn\u0027t appear to have bothered American consumers much. The share of consumers saying jobs were \"hard to get\" fell to 22.3 percent, lowest since August. \"The fact that the index was virtually unchanged reaffirms a degree of resilience on the part of consumers,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. Gas prices continued to fall, and retail sales posted a healthy 0.6 percent increase in June. Chipmakers Analog will buy Linear Analog Devices says it\u0027s buying fellow chipmaker Linear Technology of Milpitas for roughly $14.8 billion. Analog Devices said Tuesday that its offer is worth about $60 per share, 24 percent more than Linear\u0027s closing price Monday. The Norwood, Mass., company is offering $46 in cash and 0.2321 of an Analog Device share for each Linear share. Analog Devices says the combined company will have annual revenue of about $5 billion and hopes to reach $150 million in cost savings 18 months after the deal closes. It plans to issue new stock and long-term debt to fund the purchase. The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in mid-2017. Discrimination Qualcomm to settle suit Qualcomm has agreed to pay $19.5 million to settle a gender discrimination class-action lawsuit involving 3,300 women who alleged they were denied equal pay and job opportunities to their male counterparts. The settlement reached Tuesday also stipulates that the San Diego chipmaker implement policy changes and programs to better promote female employees working in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, known as STEM. Qualcomm Technologies said that it \"has strong defenses\" to the claims but agreed to make improvements. The women\u0027s lawyers say the changes could turn Qualcomm into a model in the male-dominated tech industry. The company agreed to the settlement before the lawsuit was to be filed in court Tuesday. The settlement is still subject to court approval.

BlackBerry has officially introduced its second Android phone, called the BlackBerry DTEK50. DTEK, as you might recall from its inclusion on the BlackBerry Priv , is an app that monitors the safety of your phone. The new DTEK50 also features the app (it would have a weird name otherwise) and BlackBerry insists that it is the most secure Android phone in the world. What it doesn\u0027t have is a physical QWERTY keyboard. And as we\u0027ve been saying now for weeks, it is a rebranded Alcatel Idol 4 . Of course, there are special BlackBerry features found with the DTEK50. One is the virtual QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard learns how you type the more you use it. Adding a suggested word is as simple as a flick of the finger. And gesture controls have you navigating your way around the handset like a fireman heading to a four alarm fire. With the BlackBerry Hub you can put all of your phone calls, email, social media notifications, scheduling alerts and SMS messages in one place. Gesture controls allow you to delete, snooze, flag, file, mute, and mark read/unread. With Instant Action, users can execute the following actions quickly: Making a phone call (phone, dial, call followed by a phone number/contact name) Sending an SMS (sms, message, msg, or text followed by a contact name and message) Sending an email (email, mail followed by a contact name and message) Playing music (play followed by a song, artist, or album name) Opening Google Maps for directions (map) Creating a note (note or memo followed by a title) Creating a task (task or todo followed by a title) BlackBerry Device Search scans your phone for content. And the BlackBerry Convenience Key, found on the right side of the device, can be programmed by you to open your most used app. It is up to you to decide what to do with the button. BlackBerry has released a number of videos about the DTEK50 which you can view by clicking on the video slideshow below. BlackBerry DTEK50 BlackBerry DTEK50 1. BlackBerry Hub 2.

DTEK50 is BlackBerry\u0027s second smartphone powered by Android, following the PRIV. Fully equipped with Android Marshmallow 6.0, DTEK50 combines BlackBerry\u0027s unique security, privacy and productivity with the full Android experience in an all-touch design, at a price point that\u0027s accessible for consumers and ideal for enterprise fleet deployment. \"We take our customers\u0027 privacy seriously. That\u0027s why we\u0027re proud to have all the security and privacy functionality that\u0027s built in our newest Android smartphone. DTEK50 merges the unique security and connectivity features BlackBerry is known for with the rich Android ecosystem,\" said Ralph Pini, chief operating officer and General Manager, Devices, BlackBerry. \"DTEK50 adds to BlackBerry\u0027s lineup of secure smartphones, providing choices to our customers with different price points on both BlackBerry 10 and Android platforms.\" Android Security at the Forefront In a recent survey1 of Android smartphone users, BlackBerry found that 50 percent believe their smartphone is only somewhat secure, and what\u0027s more, despite data security fears, one in six Android users don\u0027t know about Android security patches. \"With an increase in cybercrime on smartphones, people need to recognize that the private details of their lives – where they live, their bank info, pictures of their kids – are at risk on their personal device. You wouldn\u0027t leave the doors of your house unlocked at night. Having a smartphone that doesn\u0027t take your privacy seriously is the equivalent,\" said David Kleidermacher, chief security officer, BlackBerry. \"It\u0027s equally important for businesses to protect their sensitive data from cyberattacks at all points of their mobile environment – from the device to the network and servers.\" DTEK50 was designed to address the security and privacy needs of today\u0027s uncompromising Android users. Smartphones are increasingly being targeted for cyberattacks through tactics like malicious apps, scareware notifications and insecure Wi-Fi connections. BlackBerry\u0027s Android smartphones, including DTEK50 and PRIV, have unique built-in hardware security. DTEK50 encrypts all users\u0027 information, including business critical data and personal data such as pictures, videos and contacts. Malware protection is also built-in along with back-up, wipe and restore capabilities. Additional software provides users with visibility and control over which apps get access to personal info or device features such as the microphone or camera. BlackBerry also delivers security patches on the same day that Google publicly releases information about them, while many popular Android smartphones put the users\u0027 private information at risk of being hacked due to slow security updates. Features that make DTEK50 the most secure Android smartphone, include: Rapid Security Patching: BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK(TM) by BlackBerry App: Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also tracks applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust: BlackBerry\u0027s manufacturing process uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of DTEK50. Secure Boot Process: Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK50\u0027s secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening: BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improved random number, address space generation and certificate pinning to make it more difficult for attackers to target a device by scrambling application/system memory. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption: Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. Ready to Work DTEK50 combines the world\u0027s most secure smartphone with BlackBerry\u0027s enterprise management solutions to produce a powerful device capable of powering any work day. Key features include: Android(TM) for Work and Google Play(TM) for Work: Allows for fast, simple and secure integration with an enterprise environment as well as easy access to numerous rich business and IT-managed apps. Full Enterprise Mobility Management Support: DTEK50 supports BlackBerry\u0027s powerful suite of EMM applications and secure productivity solutions, including: WatchDox by BlackBerry for secure file-sharing, Good Work for business-class email and collaboration tools, Strong Authentication by BlackBerry as a VPN solution, SecuSUITE for Enterprise for secure voice and instant messaging communication, BBM Protected for encrypted messaging and BES12 for secure cross-platform management. Design Meets Function DTEK50, BlackBerry\u0027s thinnest device ever, represents the best of BlackBerry with Android to make users more productive and responsive, pairing security with intelligent design. Key features include: BlackBerry Intelligent Keyboard: DTEK50 has a smart keyboard designed to learn from users and increase typing accuracy and speed. It provides word suggestions as you type and includes up to three languages, letting you flick them into place for faster conversations. BlackBerry Hub: This unified inbox is an irreplaceable tool for consolidating all of your messages in one place – whether it\u0027s email, calendar, social or phone calls. Customizable BlackBerry Convenience Key: With the press of a button, the Convenience Key provides quick access to your most used applications and more. Stunning Screen: DTEK50 has a 5.2\" full HD display, capable of displaying 16 million colors. The screen is made of scratch-resistant glass and features a specialized oleophobic coating to protect against smudges and fingerprints. Expandable Memory: With support for micro SD cards up to 2 TB, DTEK50 provides the flexibility to add affordable and hot-swappable memory to download, install, capture and share as your needs evolve. Dazzling Camera: DTEK50 is engineered to deliver professional-looking photos with an 8MP front facing camera and a 13MP auto-focus rear camera.

The company says the DTEK50 target audience is \"everyone\" due to the increasing threat that mobile security risks now pose to the public at large. \"We feel that customers today, certainly businesses and consumers, are beginning to understand just how important security is when it comes to their smartphone,\" Alex Thurber, senior vice-president of global device sales, during a Tuesday webcast launch from the company\u0027s Waterloo headquarters. Everyone should be aware of security and privacy, he noted, whether they\u0027re the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a parent. \"I certainly want my children to have secure devices. I don\u0027t want the world looking at what they take pictures of or their emails or their text messages.\" BlackBerry said the DTEK50 has been designed to fend off cyberattacks with features such as built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. In addition, it provides the ability to see and control which apps are allowed access to features like the phone\u0027s camera. The new product is also BlackBerry\u0027s thinnest and has an on-screen keyboard - not its traditional keyboard. It appears the company has learned from the sales flop of its first Android-powered phone, the Priv. At a cost of $899, it was released late last year at the company\u0027s Canadian web store without a carrier contract. At the time, it was the most expensive Android phone on the market. While BlackBerry hasn\u0027t disclosed Priv phone sales, its most recent quarterly results released a month ago showed the company sold 500,000 smartphones in total (including the Priv). That\u0027s a drop of 100,000 from the previous quarter and 200,000 fewer than two quarters earlier. Thurber said the DTEK50 is priced to be a very broadly-adopted product and will retail for $429. The company says the new phone is currently available for preorder online, with plans to start shipping Aug. 8. \"We\u0027re very confident that from a product perspective this will sell very well,\" Thurber said. BlackBerry has faced calls to stop making smartphones because of disappointing sales and instead focus solely on its growing software and security business. Chief executive officer John Chen has so far shown no inclination to get out of the hardware business, having promised earlier this year to release two mid-range, Android-powered phones before the company\u0027s fiscal year ends Feb. 28, 2017. Thurber reiterated that commitment, saying BlackBerry will continue to develop and release Android phones, including one in the near future that will have a physical keyboard. \"Yes, one of them will be the iconic physical-keyboard-based device,\" he said. \"So stay tuned, that will be coming shortly.\" The company says it remains committed to supporting its BlackBerry 10 operating system with software updates.","ArticleSnippet":null,"Source":"PrintNews","Author":"Waterloo Region Record (Ontario, Canada)","Provider":"Newsedge","TwitterID":null,"TwitterName":"","TwitterAvatar":null,"TweetIsDeleted":false,"AuthorUrl":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatar":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatarUrl":null,"KloutScore":0,"CustomFields":null,"NumberOfLikes":null,"Outlet":"Waterloo Region Record (Ontario, Canada)","Language":"English","Sentiment":"Neutral","ArticleIsRetweet":false,"ProviderArticleId":"201607262029TS______KITCHREC_20160726-38998550","PostEngageCount":0,"ArticleUniqueID":null,"MultimediaURLs":[],"IsRightToLeft":false,"Multiplicity":false,"NLAFlag":false,"MediaCodes":null,"AudienceSizeCount":null,"AudienceTypeID":null,"AuditRecurrenceID":null,"AudienceType":null,"AuditRecurrence":null,"ExpiresOn":"","Expired":false,"MediaAvailable":false},{"MonitoringPlatformPostID":"5eb!20160727!5eb95264-282a-49cc-8faa-c7211b8088c1","MonitoredTopicID":null,"PrefGlobalReferenceName":"Eastern Standard Time","PrefDateFormat":"MM/dd/yyyy","PrefTimeFormat":"h:mmtt","SavedDate":"\/Date(1469612193900)\/","Notes":null,"IsSaved":true,"PostType":null,"SelectedTagIDs":null,"NewTagNames":null,"SourceString":"OnlineNews","SavedDateString":"07/27/2016 Eastern Standard Time","TimestampString":"07/26/2016 Eastern Standard Time","PublishedDateTimeZone":"07/26/2016|08:20|PM|Eastern Standard Time","AudienceSizeCountString":"33,655,344 Unique Visitors Monthly","ClipTimeRange":"","CriticalMentionsClipID":null,"CriticalMentionsClipStart":null,"CriticalMentionsClipEnd":null,"CriticalMentionsUUID":null,"CriticalMentionsChannelID":null,"CriticalMentionsMinTime":null,"CriticalMentionsMaxTime":null,"ProjectIDNamePairsList":[{"PostID":649900,"ProjectID":58740,"ProjectName":"note2","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true},{"PostID":649900,"ProjectID":58254,"ProjectName":"Amgen Analysts","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true}],"PostID":"649900","Timestamp":"\/Date(1469578845000)\/","Url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=27403432859\u0026p=1lh\u0026v=1\u0026x=yLmBdOg6sATXmZJc2RM2iw","Title":"Canadian stocks rally as Blackberry higher on new smartphone","Body":"Canada\u0027s main stock market in Toronto rose Tuesday on rising miners and materials stocks as Blackberry released its latest smartphone.

BlackBerry Limited went up 1.93 percent to 9.53 Canadian dollars (7.23 U.S. dollars) per share.

There were times when I was not at my best, where I shut down or became selfish, where I didn\u0027t allow myself to shine, be childish, or even take on an air of whimsical when I knew I normally could or would. But at the same time I was worried about money. My mileage check, a sizable amount that I had planned to use to fund my trip and pay for his birthday treat, had not arrived on time, thus delaying my planned departure time and prompting me to borrow money for the trip. This caused my ex and I got into a little bit of a tiff. I did not want to borrow the money, I figured I\u0027d wait the extra day for my check to arrive and then I\u0027d leave for his place. He didn\u0027t like the idea of me leaving so late in the day and thought I should just borrow the money so I could get on the road. In the end, he was right. It turns out that my check was mailed 9 days after it was cut, instead of the customary 1 day, and did not arrive until the day before I came home. Money was probably the biggest wedge between us because it drove up my feelings of resentment. Especially when things he said he bought me never appeared. I wanted the Christmas present he told me that he ordered...then it was on back order...then the retailer wasn\u0027t making it anymore...so he canceled the order...and who knows what he did with the money he used to purchase it in the first place. I wanted the Southern gift basket full of little things like grits and sweet tea, that he told me he was putting together..he was going to wait to send it to me when the Christmas present arrived... and then it promptly disappeared. I wanted the little things, nothing big or expensive just...something I didn\u0027t buy, that I could take home and show my friends and family. I did get things from him, but I wonder now if receiving these gifts were a little to late, because the lack of trust was itching at the back of my brain. But at the same time I also did get wonderful things, things that have more meaning than anything that\u0027s physical in nature. I got a beautiful handmade double dream catcher (that\u0027s pictured above) and a pressed penny, from the last bit of money he had on him. I got a ham sandwich picnic at Guntersville\u0027s National Park, overlooking the lake. I got orgasms, hugs, kisses, morning Taken 2/20/2016 by @Jodie Nicole giggles, laugher and cuddles. I got inside jokes, patience, and smiles, I got goofy looks, dances, and taken to meet the grandmother and uncle, and to his best friends family Thanksgiving dinner. I was shown some of the most beautiful spots his home state has to offer, and I enjoyed Southern hospitality. I was given all of this and more, but money still tickled the back of my brain, or maybe it was the little inconsistencies. The day he told me about the settlement I cried for joy, the waiting was over, he was coming up here and we could finally start a our life. Granted my financials were extremely tight. Tighter then I let on because I was stubborn and wanted to see him, spend time with him, give him the best birthday ever, like he gave me, but I knew I\u0027d manage, I always did. Plus school was starting, student loans given, and raises at work were soon due to be handed out, everything was looking up for us...or so I thought. Fear is an incredible thing. So isn\u0027t money. The power these two commodities have over people is amazing. I understand the power of fear, having been controlled by it before, but I\u0027ve never really understood the power of money until very recently. I know one of the first things his friends wondered about me, after I came into the picture was, is she after his settlement. This floored me, mainly because I didn\u0027t fathom the concept of being with someone for money. I knew it happened, but...it still felt like a strange notion. I wonder now, if he feels that, his settlement was the reason I stayed with him, especially after I asked him for a check. The truth is, I never gave a damn about his settlement. From day one, I asked him to use the money for himself, and he consistently told me that moving up here, to be with me, was him using it for himself. Unfortunately, this also means that him changing his mind about coming up here is also him using his money for himself and thus doing exactly what I asked him to do. My readers may think that my grief is over him not moving up here, and there is some truth to that, but it\u0027s only a sliver of the bigger picture. What hurt the most was the fact that he gave up. For months he\u0027d talk about fighting for me, for us, to keep us together, despite the distance. He told me \"we\" were worth the fight and that you\u0027d have a more luck breaking into Fort Knox, then tearing him away from me. But in the end he gave up. He wasn\u0027t willing to compromise, to fight, to even try to figure out how we could continue to make this work despite the distance. And do you know what\u0027s truly messed up? Apart of me is still fighting for \"us\" crazy as it seems. Or should I say crazy fool that I am.
