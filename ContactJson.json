claims DTEK50 is \u0027world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone\u0027","Body":"BlackBerry\u0027s new DTEK50 may be the world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone, as the company claims, but there\u0027s no real indication of when it will reach our shores. The DTEK50 is BlackBerry\u0027s second Android-based phone. The first was the PRIV. Customers in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands can pre-order a DTEK50 for US$299. As for Australia, all we\u0027re told is that \"Availability of the smartphone in other channels and countries will be announced at a later date.\" The DTEK50 runs Android Marshmallow 6.0 with BlackBerry\u0027s security enhancements. These include Android hardening, rapid security patching (same day as Google), the DTEK app (monitors OS and app security, including warnings when apps take pictures or videos, activate the microphone on, send a text message, or access contacts or location), secure boot, and FIPS 140-2 compliant full disk encryption. \"We take our customers\u0027 privacy seriously. That\u0027s why we\u0027re excited with all the security and functionality that\u0027s built in our newest Android smartphone. DTEK50 merges the unique security and connectivity features BlackBerry is known for, with the rich Android ecosystem\", said BlackBerry chief operating officer and general manager of devices, Ralph Pini. \"This device adds to BlackBerry\u0027s lineup of secure smartphones, providing choice to our customers with different price points on both, BlackBerry 10 and Android platforms.\" BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher said \"With an increase in cybercrime on smartphones, consumers need to recognise that the private details of their lives - where they live, their bank info, pictures of their kids - are at risk on their personal device. \"You wouldn\u0027t leave the doors of your house unlocked at night. Having a smartphone that doesn\u0027t take your privacy seriously is the equivalent. \"It\u0027s equally important for businesses to protect their sensitive data from cyberattacks at all points of their mobile environment - from the device to the network and servers.\" So DTEK50 includes Android for Work and Google Play for Work, and works with BlackBerry\u0027s enterprise mobility management and secure productivity apps including WatchDox, Good Work, SecuSUITE for Enterprise, BBM Protected for encrypted messaging and BES12. For user convenience, the DTEK50 includes the BlackBerry Hub unified for email, calendar, social and phone calls, and the customisable BlackBerry Convenience Key for quick access to the most used applications and other capabilities. Hardware features include a 5.2in full HD display with oleophobic surface, support for microSD cards up to 2TB, an 8MP front camera and a 13MP rear camera with phase detection auto focus (for instant focussing) and dual-tone LED flash for realistic looking photos in low light.","ArticleSnippet":null,"Source":"OnlineNews","Author":"ITWire | Stephen Withers","Provider":"Moreover","TwitterID":null,"TwitterName":"","TwitterAvatar":null,"TweetIsDeleted":false,"AuthorUrl":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatar":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatarUrl":null,"KloutScore":0,"CustomFields":null,"NumberOfLikes":null,"Outlet":"ITWire","Language":"English","Sentiment":"Positive","ArticleIsRetweet":false,"ProviderArticleId":"27404046436","PostEngageCount":0,"ArticleUniqueID":null,"MultimediaURLs":["http://www.itwire.com/media/k2/items/cache/3b36c7ef58f538a4bde21fe4dd03589a_XS.jpg"],"IsRightToLeft":false,"Multiplicity":false,"NLAFlag":false,"MediaCodes":null,"AudienceSizeCount":null,"AudienceTypeID":null,"AuditRecurrenceID":null,"AudienceType":null,"AuditRecurrence":null,"ExpiresOn":"","Expired":false,"MediaAvailable":false},{"MonitoringPlatformPostID":"0c4!20160727!0c446665-ded3-4023-adb6-e02a4c7d8a8c","MonitoredTopicID":null,"PrefGlobalReferenceName":"Eastern Standard Time","PrefDateFormat":"MM/dd/yyyy","PrefTimeFormat":"h:mmtt","SavedDate":"\/Date(1469612193900)\/","Notes":null,"IsSaved":true,"PostType":2,"SelectedTagIDs":null,"NewTagNames":null,"SourceString":"OnlineNews","SavedDateString":"07/27/2016 Eastern Standard Time","TimestampString":"07/26/2016 Eastern Standard Time","PublishedDateTimeZone":"07/26/2016|09:33|PM|Eastern Standard Time","AudienceSizeCountString":"90,965 Unique Visitors Monthly","ClipTimeRange":"","CriticalMentionsClipID":null,"CriticalMentionsClipStart":null,"CriticalMentionsClipEnd":null,"CriticalMentionsUUID":null,"CriticalMentionsChannelID":null,"CriticalMentionsMinTime":null,"CriticalMentionsMaxTime":null,"ProjectIDNamePairsList":[{"PostID":649881,"ProjectID":58740,"ProjectName":"note2","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true},{"PostID":649881,"ProjectID":58254,"ProjectName":"Amgen Analysts","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true}],"PostID":"649881","Timestamp":"\/Date(1469583180000)\/","Url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=27403962788\u0026p=1lh\u0026v=1\u0026x=WGG6krfShsAds_O-9qKxyg","Title":"Blackberry announces DETK50, a secure US$299 Android phone  999999999999","Body":"BlackBerry\u0027s first Android phone, the Priv , wasn\u0027t half bad. It just didn\u0027t offer enough to justify that $700 price. If you were enticed by the security features of the Priv, but you don\u0027t want to spend that kind of money (and don\u0027t need a physical keyboard), you\u0027re in luck. The company just announced its second Android phone, and it only costs $299. The DTEK50 (doesn\u0027t that name just roll off the tongue?) appears to be a barely-modified Alcatel Idol 4 . The only hardware change seems to be a new backplate that bears the Blackberry logo. It has a 5.2-inch 1080p display, Snapdragon 617 processor, 13MP rear-facing and 8MP front-facing cameras, and 2610 mAh battery. You\u0027ll find 3GB of RAM, 16GB of flash storage, and SD card support. Note that the phone isn\u0027t based off the superior Idol 4S, which has a higher-res display, larger battery, and better camera. On the software side, BlackBerry has added its own special sauce to improve security and privacy. The company claims it\u0027s \"the world\u0027s most secure Android phone,\" though that claim doesn\u0027t appear to be qualified by an independent authority. In its press release, BlackBerry lists the following features as evidence of the phone\u0027s hardened security: Rapid Security Patching: BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK by BlackBerry App: Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also tracks applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust: BlackBerry\u0027s manufacturing process uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of DTEK50. Secure Boot Process: Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK50\u0027s secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening : BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improved random number, address space generation and certificate pinning to make it more difficult for attackers to target a device by scrambling application/system memory. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption : Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. The phone is up for preorder now on BlackBerry.com, in a bundle with an external battery pack for $299. It will go on sale in retail around August 8th. The story behind the story: Once a mobile powerhouse, BlackBerry has fallen on hard times. The Priv was supposed to turn the company around, but suffered poor sales. By taking an existing design and focusing on BlackBerry\u0027s strengths in security and manageability, it\u0027s able to field a much more affordable option. It\u0027s possible that this is the way forward for the company, but I predict the market will shrug off this device as well. BlackBerry may eventually stop making hardware altogether, instead focusing on its expertise in security and device management as a software and services company.

BlackBerry unveiled an Android-based handset on Wednesday, a device that combines Google\u0027s popular software and broad app catalogue with the company\u0027s security and productivity features at a lower price. The faded smartphone pioneer is hoping the DTEK50 will sell in greater numbers than the Priv, its first phone using the Android operating system, which chief executive John Chen has said suffered because of its high price. The company said the touchscreen-only DTEK50 will cost US$299. It will be released this month, though it\u0027s not available in New Zealand yet. Calling the DTEK50 \"the world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone\", BlackBerry said it will alert users if someone is making remote use of its camera or microphone, or accessing the phone\u0027s location information. At its November launch the Priv, which featured a slide out keyboard, cost US$699. The company cut the price of the Priv, while earlier this month it said it would cease production of its Classic handset, which uses its own BlackBerry 10 operating system. A third Android device is expected from BlackBerry in coming months. - Reuters Comments","ArticleSnippet":null,"Source":"OnlineNews","Author":"Dominion Post","Provider":"Moreover","TwitterID":null,"TwitterName":"","TwitterAvatar":null,"TweetIsDeleted":false,"AuthorUrl":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatar":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatarUrl":null,"KloutScore":0,"CustomFields":null,"NumberOfLikes":null,"Outlet":"Dominion Post","Language":"English","Sentiment":"Neutral","ArticleIsRetweet":false,"ProviderArticleId":"27403788980","PostEngageCount":0,"ArticleUniqueID":null,"MultimediaURLs":[],"IsRightToLeft":false,"Multiplicity":false,"NLAFlag":false,"MediaCodes":null,"AudienceSizeCount":2422283,"AudienceTypeID":2,"AuditRecurrenceID":5,"AudienceType":2,"AuditRecurrence":5,"ExpiresOn":"","Expired":false,"MediaAvailable":false},{"MonitoringPlatformPostID":"584!20160727!58478686-a856-434a-9127-659c5f1de140","MonitoredTopicID":null,"PrefGlobalReferenceName":"Eastern Standard Time","PrefDateFormat":"MM/dd/yyyy","PrefTimeFormat":"h:mmtt","SavedDate":"\/Date(1469612193900)\/","Notes":null,"IsSaved":true,"PostType":null,"SelectedTagIDs":null,"NewTagNames":null,"SourceString":"OnlineNews","SavedDateString":"07/27/2016 Eastern Standard Time","TimestampString":"07/26/2016 Eastern Standard Time","PublishedDateTimeZone":"07/26/2016|09:07|PM|Eastern Standard Time","AudienceSizeCountString":"","ClipTimeRange":"","CriticalMentionsClipID":null,"CriticalMentionsClipStart":null,"CriticalMentionsClipEnd":null,"CriticalMentionsUUID":null,"CriticalMentionsChannelID":null,"CriticalMentionsMinTime":null,"CriticalMentionsMaxTime":null,"ProjectIDNamePairsList":[{"PostID":649885,"ProjectID":58740,"ProjectName":"note2","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true},{"PostID":649885,"ProjectID":58254,"ProjectName":"Amgen Analysts","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true}],"PostID":"649885","Timestamp":"\/Date(1469581620000)\/","Url":"http://www.enterprise-security-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=102590","Title":"BlackBerry Unveils \u0027World\u0027s Most Secure Android Smartphone\u0027","Body":"Priced considerably lower than BlackBerry\u0027s first Android phone, the new DTEK50 is being touted by the Canadian firm as \"the world\u0027s most secure Android smartphone.\" Available for pre-ordering today, the $299 DTEK50 is set to ship on August 8.

The company announced the launch Tuesday of the DTEK50, a phone it hopes will appeal to \"everyone\" due to the insidious threat that mobile security risks now pose to the public at large. \"We feel that customers today, certainly businesses and consumers, are beginning to understand just how important security is when it comes to their smartphone,\" said Alex Thurber, senior vice-president of global device sales, during a webcast from BlackBerry\u0027s headquarters in Waterloo, Ont. Everyone should be aware of security and privacy, whether they\u0027re the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a parent, he said. \"I certainly want my children to have secure devices. I don\u0027t want the world looking at what they take pictures of or their emails or their text messages.\" BlackBerry (TSX:BB) said the DTEK50 has been designed to fend off cyberattacks with features such as built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. In addition, it provides the ability to see and control which apps are allowed access to features like the phone\u0027s camera. The new product is also BlackBerry\u0027s thinnest and has an on-screen keyboard _ not its traditional keyboard. The DTEK50 will retail for C$429, a sign that the company may have learned from the sales flop of its first Android-powered phone, the Priv. At a cost of C$899 without a carrier contract, the Priv was released late last year and at the time, it was the most expensive Android phone on the market. While BlackBerry hasn\u0027t disclosed Priv phone sales, its most recent quarterly results released a month ago showed the company sold 500,000 smartphones in total (including the Priv). That\u0027s a drop of 100,000 over the previous quarter and 200,000 fewer than two quarters earlier. \"We\u0027re very confident that from a product perspective this will sell very well,\" Thurber said of the DTEK50. But that price likely won\u0027t be enough to win over a large number of customers, said Detlev Zwick, an associate professor of marketing at York University\u0027s Schulich School of Business. They will ask themselves what makes the DTEK50 different from other phones in the same price range, and while the answer may be its stronger security measures, that may not be enough to sway them, he said. \"I think most consumers in that price range simply don\u0027t care much about that,\" he said. Instead, they\u0027re more concerned with how user-friendly an interface is, how fun applications are and how quickly they can access their Facebook friends, Zwick said. \"If they really want to change momentum, BlackBerry would need a hit with a handset,\" he continued. \"This is not it.\" BlackBerry has faced calls to stop making smartphones because of disappointing sales and instead focus solely on its growing software and security business. CEO John Chen has so far shown no inclination to heed those calls, having promised earlier this year to release two mid-range, Android-powered phones before the company\u0027s fiscal year ends Feb. 28, 2017. Thurber reiterated that commitment, saying BlackBerry will continue to develop and release Android phones, including one in the near future that will have a physical keyboard. The DTEK50 is available for pre-order online, with plans to start shipping Aug. 8.

The chain, which is based in San Francisco but owned by Intercontinental Hotels Group, said that it was recently made aware of unauthorized charges on cards used at its hotels. It\u0027s unclear how many people or which of its 62 hotels were affected. \"We recommend that individuals closely monitor their payment card account statements,\" a spokeswoman said in an email. \"If there are unauthorized charges, individuals should immediately notify their bank.\" Brian Krebs, who runs the security news site KrebsOnSecurity, initially reported the possible breach. Earnings Gilead shares fall on outlook Gilead Sciences fell the most in almost three months after the company cut its product sales forecast for 2016 and reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales for its hepatitis C drugs. Shares of Foster City\u0027s Gilead fell 8.5 percent to close at $81.05 Tuesday. The drop came in the wake of the biotech company\u0027s earnings report Monday. Although profit topped analysts\u0027 estimates, the company\u0027s outlook disappointed Wall Street. Net product sales will be $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion for the year, it said, down from a previous outlook of $30 billion to $31 billion. The company also expects to spend more on research and development this year. The drugmaker\u0027s hepatitis C pills, Sovaldi and Harvoni, brought in $3.92 billion, missing the $4.06 billion average of projections. Smartphones Security focus for BlackBerry BlackBerry unveiled its latest smartphone, a security-focused touch-screen Android device that it hopes will make the company\u0027s money-losing handset business profitable. At $299, the DTEK50 is priced for midmarket users, cutting in half the original retail cost of BlackBerry\u0027s first Android phone, the Priv, which the company admits was too expensive to appeal to a broad audience. Advance orders are being accepted for the DTEK50 in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, BlackBerry said Tuesday. The DTEK50 is designed for people who demand a stronger sense of security with their mobile phones, either because they fear for their privacy in a world of hackers and data leaks or because their employers require it. Restaurants Zagat revamps ratings in guide Zagat, the restaurant guide known for including quotes from customers, is getting rid of its classic 30-point rating scale in favor of a more streamlined system that will incorporate Google Maps and Search into a redesigned, more personal mobile app. From now on, reviews will be based on a five-tier system, ranking restaurants on a scale from \"poor\" to \"perfection,\" instead of asking diners to differentiate between a rating of 21 or 22 in multiple categories. The new app, which will be available first on Apple\u0027s iOS, will have a sleeker design that reflects the sparse simplicity of Google, which bought the dining guide in 2011 for $151 million. The changes will also put Zagat in line with competing digital reviewers like Yelp and TripAdvisor. \"We thought it was time to cook up an update to our iOS app to provide our foodie fans with the freshest, most relevant content — while on the go,\" according to a Zagat blog post Tuesday. The guide started in New York as a newsletter more than 35 years ago. Economy Mixed feelings by consumers American consumers are feeling confident about current economic conditions but are a bit warier about the future. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index was essentially unchanged in July, dipping to 97.3 from a revised 97.4 in June. The business group\u0027s index includes consumers\u0027 assessment of the economy now and what they expect over the next six months. Their view of today\u0027s economy rose to the highest level since September, but their outlook slipped. The survey was the first to measure sentiment since Britain voted June 23 to leave the European Union. That vote rattled financial markets but doesn\u0027t appear to have bothered American consumers much. The share of consumers saying jobs were \"hard to get\" fell to 22.3 percent, lowest since August. \"The fact that the index was virtually unchanged reaffirms a degree of resilience on the part of consumers,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. Gas prices continued to fall, and retail sales posted a healthy 0.6 percent increase in June. Chipmakers Analog will buy Linear Analog Devices says it\u0027s buying fellow chipmaker Linear Technology of Milpitas for roughly $14.8 billion. Analog Devices said Tuesday that its offer is worth about $60 per share, 24 percent more than Linear\u0027s closing price Monday. The Norwood, Mass., company is offering $46 in cash and 0.2321 of an Analog Device share for each Linear share. Analog Devices says the combined company will have annual revenue of about $5 billion and hopes to reach $150 million in cost savings 18 months after the deal closes. It plans to issue new stock and long-term debt to fund the purchase. The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in mid-2017. Discrimination Qualcomm to settle suit Qualcomm has agreed to pay $19.5 million to settle a gender discrimination class-action lawsuit involving 3,300 women who alleged they were denied equal pay and job opportunities to their male counterparts. The settlement reached Tuesday also stipulates that the San Diego chipmaker implement policy changes and programs to better promote female employees working in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, known as STEM. Qualcomm Technologies said that it \"has strong defenses\" to the claims but agreed to make improvements. The women\u0027s lawyers say the changes could turn Qualcomm into a model in the male-dominated tech industry. The company agreed to the settlement before the lawsuit was to be filed in court Tuesday. The settlement is still subject to court approval.

BlackBerry has officially introduced its second Android phone, called the BlackBerry DTEK50. DTEK, as you might recall from its inclusion on the BlackBerry Priv , is an app that monitors the safety of your phone. The new DTEK50 also features the app (it would have a weird name otherwise) and BlackBerry insists that it is the most secure Android phone in the world. What it doesn\u0027t have is a physical QWERTY keyboard. And as we\u0027ve been saying now for weeks, it is a rebranded Alcatel Idol 4 . Of course, there are special BlackBerry features found with the DTEK50. One is the virtual QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard learns how you type the more you use it. Adding a suggested word is as simple as a flick of the finger. And gesture controls have you navigating your way around the handset like a fireman heading to a four alarm fire. With the BlackBerry Hub you can put all of your phone calls, email, social media notifications, scheduling alerts and SMS messages in one place. Gesture controls allow you to delete, snooze, flag, file, mute, and mark read/unread. With Instant Action, users can execute the following actions quickly: Making a phone call (phone, dial, call followed by a phone number/contact name) Sending an SMS (sms, message, msg, or text followed by a contact name and message) Sending an email (email, mail followed by a contact name and message) Playing music (play followed by a song, artist, or album name) Opening Google Maps for directions (map) Creating a note (note or memo followed by a title) Creating a task (task or todo followed by a title) BlackBerry Device Search scans your phone for content. And the BlackBerry Convenience Key, found on the right side of the device, can be programmed by you to open your most used app. It is up to you to decide what to do with the button. BlackBerry has released a number of videos about the DTEK50 which you can view by clicking on the video slideshow below. BlackBerry DTEK50 BlackBerry DTEK50 1. BlackBerry Hub 2.

DTEK50 is BlackBerry\u0027s second smartphone powered by Android, following the PRIV. Fully equipped with Android Marshmallow 6.0, DTEK50 combines BlackBerry\u0027s unique security, privacy and productivity with the full Android experience in an all-touch design, at a price point that\u0027s accessible for consumers and ideal for enterprise fleet deployment. \"We take our customers\u0027 privacy seriously. That\u0027s why we\u0027re proud to have all the security and privacy functionality that\u0027s built in our newest Android smartphone. DTEK50 merges the unique security and connectivity features BlackBerry is known for with the rich Android ecosystem,\" said Ralph Pini, chief operating officer and General Manager, Devices, BlackBerry. \"DTEK50 adds to BlackBerry\u0027s lineup of secure smartphones, providing choices to our customers with different price points on both BlackBerry 10 and Android platforms.\" Android Security at the Forefront In a recent survey1 of Android smartphone users, BlackBerry found that 50 percent believe their smartphone is only somewhat secure, and what\u0027s more, despite data security fears, one in six Android users don\u0027t know about Android security patches. \"With an increase in cybercrime on smartphones, people need to recognize that the private details of their lives – where they live, their bank info, pictures of their kids – are at risk on their personal device. You wouldn\u0027t leave the doors of your house unlocked at night. Having a smartphone that doesn\u0027t take your privacy seriously is the equivalent,\" said David Kleidermacher, chief security officer, BlackBerry. \"It\u0027s equally important for businesses to protect their sensitive data from cyberattacks at all points of their mobile environment – from the device to the network and servers.\" DTEK50 was designed to address the security and privacy needs of today\u0027s uncompromising Android users. Smartphones are increasingly being targeted for cyberattacks through tactics like malicious apps, scareware notifications and insecure Wi-Fi connections. BlackBerry\u0027s Android smartphones, including DTEK50 and PRIV, have unique built-in hardware security. DTEK50 encrypts all users\u0027 information, including business critical data and personal data such as pictures, videos and contacts. Malware protection is also built-in along with back-up, wipe and restore capabilities. Additional software provides users with visibility and control over which apps get access to personal info or device features such as the microphone or camera. BlackBerry also delivers security patches on the same day that Google publicly releases information about them, while many popular Android smartphones put the users\u0027 private information at risk of being hacked due to slow security updates. Features that make DTEK50 the most secure Android smartphone, include: Rapid Security Patching: BlackBerry has a record of being the quickest to deliver security patches, setting the bar in incident response and patch management to protect your device from malicious threats. DTEK(TM) by BlackBerry App: Enables users to automatically monitor their OS and apps to know when their privacy could be at risk and to take action to improve it. The DTEK app also tracks applications and notifies you when someone is: taking pictures or videos without your knowledge, turning your microphone on, sending a text message, or accessing your contacts or location. Hardware Root of Trust: BlackBerry\u0027s manufacturing process uses a proprietary technique that adds security from the start, allowing for the tracking, verification and provisioning of DTEK50. Secure Boot Process: Starting with the root of trust, each stage of DTEK50\u0027s secure boot chain must first verify that the next component is fully intact before proceeding, ensuring your device has not been tampered with since the last restart. Android OS hardening: BlackBerry provides additional security patches, improved random number, address space generation and certificate pinning to make it more difficult for attackers to target a device by scrambling application/system memory. FIPS 140-2 Compliant Full Disk Encryption: Protects your private information, like pictures or bank information, from being stolen if you were to lose your phone. Ready to Work DTEK50 combines the world\u0027s most secure smartphone with BlackBerry\u0027s enterprise management solutions to produce a powerful device capable of powering any work day. Key features include: Android(TM) for Work and Google Play(TM) for Work: Allows for fast, simple and secure integration with an enterprise environment as well as easy access to numerous rich business and IT-managed apps. Full Enterprise Mobility Management Support: DTEK50 supports BlackBerry\u0027s powerful suite of EMM applications and secure productivity solutions, including: WatchDox by BlackBerry for secure file-sharing, Good Work for business-class email and collaboration tools, Strong Authentication by BlackBerry as a VPN solution, SecuSUITE for Enterprise for secure voice and instant messaging communication, BBM Protected for encrypted messaging and BES12 for secure cross-platform management. Design Meets Function DTEK50, BlackBerry\u0027s thinnest device ever, represents the best of BlackBerry with Android to make users more productive and responsive, pairing security with intelligent design. Key features include: BlackBerry Intelligent Keyboard: DTEK50 has a smart keyboard designed to learn from users and increase typing accuracy and speed. It provides word suggestions as you type and includes up to three languages, letting you flick them into place for faster conversations. BlackBerry Hub: This unified inbox is an irreplaceable tool for consolidating all of your messages in one place – whether it\u0027s email, calendar, social or phone calls. Customizable BlackBerry Convenience Key: With the press of a button, the Convenience Key provides quick access to your most used applications and more. Stunning Screen: DTEK50 has a 5.2\" full HD display, capable of displaying 16 million colors. The screen is made of scratch-resistant glass and features a specialized oleophobic coating to protect against smudges and fingerprints. Expandable Memory: With support for micro SD cards up to 2 TB, DTEK50 provides the flexibility to add affordable and hot-swappable memory to download, install, capture and share as your needs evolve. Dazzling Camera: DTEK50 is engineered to deliver professional-looking photos with an 8MP front facing camera and a 13MP auto-focus rear camera.

The company says the DTEK50 target audience is \"everyone\" due to the increasing threat that mobile security risks now pose to the public at large. \"We feel that customers today, certainly businesses and consumers, are beginning to understand just how important security is when it comes to their smartphone,\" Alex Thurber, senior vice-president of global device sales, during a Tuesday webcast launch from the company\u0027s Waterloo headquarters. Everyone should be aware of security and privacy, he noted, whether they\u0027re the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a parent. \"I certainly want my children to have secure devices. I don\u0027t want the world looking at what they take pictures of or their emails or their text messages.\" BlackBerry said the DTEK50 has been designed to fend off cyberattacks with features such as built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. In addition, it provides the ability to see and control which apps are allowed access to features like the phone\u0027s camera. The new product is also BlackBerry\u0027s thinnest and has an on-screen keyboard - not its traditional keyboard. It appears the company has learned from the sales flop of its first Android-powered phone, the Priv. At a cost of $899, it was released late last year at the company\u0027s Canadian web store without a carrier contract. At the time, it was the most expensive Android phone on the market. While BlackBerry hasn\u0027t disclosed Priv phone sales, its most recent quarterly results released a month ago showed the company sold 500,000 smartphones in total (including the Priv). That\u0027s a drop of 100,000 from the previous quarter and 200,000 fewer than two quarters earlier. Thurber said the DTEK50 is priced to be a very broadly-adopted product and will retail for $429. The company says the new phone is currently available for preorder online, with plans to start shipping Aug. 8. \"We\u0027re very confident that from a product perspective this will sell very well,\" Thurber said. BlackBerry has faced calls to stop making smartphones because of disappointing sales and instead focus solely on its growing software and security business. Chief executive officer John Chen has so far shown no inclination to get out of the hardware business, having promised earlier this year to release two mid-range, Android-powered phones before the company\u0027s fiscal year ends Feb. 28, 2017. Thurber reiterated that commitment, saying BlackBerry will continue to develop and release Android phones, including one in the near future that will have a physical keyboard. \"Yes, one of them will be the iconic physical-keyboard-based device,\" he said. \"So stay tuned, that will be coming shortly.\" The company says it remains committed to supporting its BlackBerry 10 operating system with software updates.","ArticleSnippet":null,"Source":"PrintNews","Author":"Waterloo Region Record (Ontario, Canada)","Provider":"Newsedge","TwitterID":null,"TwitterName":"","TwitterAvatar":null,"TweetIsDeleted":false,"AuthorUrl":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatar":null,"EncryptedTwitterAvatarUrl":null,"KloutScore":0,"CustomFields":null,"NumberOfLikes":null,"Outlet":"Waterloo Region Record (Ontario, Canada)","Language":"English","Sentiment":"Neutral","ArticleIsRetweet":false,"ProviderArticleId":"201607262029TS______KITCHREC_20160726-38998550","PostEngageCount":0,"ArticleUniqueID":null,"MultimediaURLs":[],"IsRightToLeft":false,"Multiplicity":false,"NLAFlag":false,"MediaCodes":null,"AudienceSizeCount":null,"AudienceTypeID":null,"AuditRecurrenceID":null,"AudienceType":null,"AuditRecurrence":null,"ExpiresOn":"","Expired":false,"MediaAvailable":false},{"MonitoringPlatformPostID":"5eb!20160727!5eb95264-282a-49cc-8faa-c7211b8088c1","MonitoredTopicID":null,"PrefGlobalReferenceName":"Eastern Standard Time","PrefDateFormat":"MM/dd/yyyy","PrefTimeFormat":"h:mmtt","SavedDate":"\/Date(1469612193900)\/","Notes":null,"IsSaved":true,"PostType":null,"SelectedTagIDs":null,"NewTagNames":null,"SourceString":"OnlineNews","SavedDateString":"07/27/2016 Eastern Standard Time","TimestampString":"07/26/2016 Eastern Standard Time","PublishedDateTimeZone":"07/26/2016|08:20|PM|Eastern Standard Time","AudienceSizeCountString":"33,655,344 Unique Visitors Monthly","ClipTimeRange":"","CriticalMentionsClipID":null,"CriticalMentionsClipStart":null,"CriticalMentionsClipEnd":null,"CriticalMentionsUUID":null,"CriticalMentionsChannelID":null,"CriticalMentionsMinTime":null,"CriticalMentionsMaxTime":null,"ProjectIDNamePairsList":[{"PostID":649900,"ProjectID":58740,"ProjectName":"note2","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true},{"PostID":649900,"ProjectID":58254,"ProjectName":"Amgen Analysts","UserID":568,"IsReadonly":true}],"PostID":"649900","Timestamp":"\/Date(1469578845000)\/","Url":"http://ct.moreover.com/?a=27403432859\u0026p=1lh\u0026v=1\u0026x=yLmBdOg6sATXmZJc2RM2iw","Title":"Canadian stocks rally as Blackberry higher on new smartphone","Body":"Canada\u0027s main stock market in Toronto rose Tuesday on rising miners and materials stocks as Blackberry released its latest smartphone.

BlackBerry Limited went up 1.93 percent to 9.53 Canadian dollars (7.23 U.S. dollars) per share.

There were times when I was not at my best, where I shut down or became selfish, where I didn\u0027t allow myself to shine, be childish, or even take on an air of whimsical when I knew I normally could or would. But at the same time I was worried about money. My mileage check, a sizable amount that I had planned to use to fund my trip and pay for his birthday treat, had not arrived on time, thus delaying my planned departure time and prompting me to borrow money for the trip. This caused my ex and I got into a little bit of a tiff. I did not want to borrow the money, I figured I\u0027d wait the extra day for my check to arrive and then I\u0027d leave for his place. He didn\u0027t like the idea of me leaving so late in the day and thought I should just borrow the money so I could get on the road. In the end, he was right. It turns out that my check was mailed 9 days after it was cut, instead of the customary 1 day, and did not arrive until the day before I came home. Money was probably the biggest wedge between us because it drove up my feelings of resentment. Especially when things he said he bought me never appeared. I wanted the Christmas present he told me that he ordered...then it was on back order...then the retailer wasn\u0027t making it anymore...so he canceled the order...and who knows what he did with the money he used to purchase it in the first place. I wanted the Southern gift basket full of little things like grits and sweet tea, that he told me he was putting together..he was going to wait to send it to me when the Christmas present arrived... and then it promptly disappeared. I wanted the little things, nothing big or expensive just...something I didn\u0027t buy, that I could take home and show my friends and family. I did get things from him, but I wonder now if receiving these gifts were a little to late, because the lack of trust was itching at the back of my brain. But at the same time I also did get wonderful things, things that have more meaning than anything that\u0027s physical in nature. I got a beautiful handmade double dream catcher (that\u0027s pictured above) and a pressed penny, from the last bit of money he had on him. I got a ham sandwich picnic at Guntersville\u0027s National Park, overlooking the lake. I got orgasms, hugs, kisses, morning Taken 2/20/2016 by @Jodie Nicole giggles, laugher and cuddles. I got inside jokes, patience, and smiles, I got goofy looks, dances, and taken to meet the grandmother and uncle, and to his best friends family Thanksgiving dinner. I was shown some of the most beautiful spots his home state has to offer, and I enjoyed Southern hospitality. I was given all of this and more, but money still tickled the back of my brain, or maybe it was the little inconsistencies. The day he told me about the settlement I cried for joy, the waiting was over, he was coming up here and we could finally start a our life. Granted my financials were extremely tight. Tighter then I let on because I was stubborn and wanted to see him, spend time with him, give him the best birthday ever, like he gave me, but I knew I\u0027d manage, I always did. Plus school was starting, student loans given, and raises at work were soon due to be handed out, everything was looking up for us...or so I thought. Fear is an incredible thing. So isn\u0027t money. The power these two commodities have over people is amazing. I understand the power of fear, having been controlled by it before, but I\u0027ve never really understood the power of money until very recently. I know one of the first things his friends wondered about me, after I came into the picture was, is she after his settlement. This floored me, mainly because I didn\u0027t fathom the concept of being with someone for money. I knew it happened, but...it still felt like a strange notion. I wonder now, if he feels that, his settlement was the reason I stayed with him, especially after I asked him for a check. The truth is, I never gave a damn about his settlement. From day one, I asked him to use the money for himself, and he consistently told me that moving up here, to be with me, was him using it for himself. Unfortunately, this also means that him changing his mind about coming up here is also him using his money for himself and thus doing exactly what I asked him to do. My readers may think that my grief is over him not moving up here, and there is some truth to that, but it\u0027s only a sliver of the bigger picture. What hurt the most was the fact that he gave up. For months he\u0027d talk about fighting for me, for us, to keep us together, despite the distance. He told me \"we\" were worth the fight and that you\u0027d have a more luck breaking into Fort Knox, then tearing him away from me. But in the end he gave up. He wasn\u0027t willing to compromise, to fight, to even try to figure out how we could continue to make this work despite the distance. And do you know what\u0027s truly messed up? Apart of me is still fighting for \"us\" crazy as it seems. Or should I say crazy fool that I am.

His lack of maintenance especially stands out since his neighbors do a good job of caring for their respective - multi-units. I told you that during the last several years - I have been \"shuffling\" back and forth between Chicago and Pittsburgh\u0027s - Squirrel Hill - a trendy part of Pittsburgh which is hilly and lovely. As you well know - when I leave Chicago - I - and stay in mountainous Pittsburgh for a while - before the splendid Chicago - starts calling me back - while Max has always loved Pittsburgh\u0027s Squirrel Hill - where he bought his old castle style - big, three unit house - many years ago. Even though Squirrel Hill is a gorgeous part of Pittsburgh - a city full of picturesque hills - there is no other city for me like \"my\" Chicago - notwithstanding its numerous problems which change from summer to summer. Still - the summers in Chicago by the glorious, changing colors daily, sweet smelling lake Michigan - are always fantastic. At times - I like to remember the summers when Max\u0027s girls were little while we were very young in Pittsburgh\u0027s - Squirrel Hill. It seems like only yesterday his older daughter who just turned thirty five - was a year old, just learned how to walk so mother and I dressed her up like a doll and pushed her stroller around the hilly and gorgeous - Squirrel Hill. When almost everybody commented how beautiful this child looks - our mother made her famous \"figas\" under the stroller - the famous folding of the thumb finger between the index and the third finger - to ward off any bad spirits which may act up in response to those numerous admiring and envious - compliments. Today - she is all grown up - and has an adorable, three year old little boy of her own - little Cyril whom I adore. When I pick him up and look into his pretty brown eyes - he looks amazingly just like his mother when she was a toddler - almost as if a part of her spirit got embedded into her son. He always tells me his baby tales since he talks a lot like a little genius - of course - like everybody in our family. His little voice always sounds great to me; I could listen to him - forever. You know how the magic of love renders us blind, deaf, stupid and insane - for a while - anyway. I am expecting little Cyril and my niece (his mother) plus her husband to visit me this summer in Chicago. Her voice sounds good to me when I talk to her - almost - every week. I can\u0027t wait to hug this little guy - again - and hear his small but amazingly clear voice tell me his little stories - again. For certain - as our lives progress - our thrills and joys - also undergo steady changes. Tina - I told you before that a lot of the important decisions which I make about some major decisions for my life - feel to me as if some outside force prompts me to go in certain direction; its a good force - I know that - even though - I can\u0027t readily identify how - exactly - those decisions are made. I know that everything that happens - comes out for the best even if at times - things seem going in a rough manner. Lately I decided to hang out with some new friends since a lot of my old Chicago friends started to get on my nerves for various reasons. For example - I used to always adore Milochka - no matter how rudely and in an inconsiderate manner - she frequently expresses her unsolicited opinions regarding my life - which has been her lifelong annoying habit. Lately - after I put some distance between Milochka - she finally straightened out to a great extent - her lifelong, deeply rooted, unpleasant habits. It took a while - but I am not going anywhere in the near future - so in the interim - our glamorous cousin Yulitchka - is my major confidante. I can\u0027t wait to visit her, hug her, smell her beautiful perfume and see her family (our second cousins) again - in the beautiful Vancouver, B.C where they have lived for the last fifteen years. That project keeps me busy; its one of my long term tasks - another one is my future trip to Israel - while some other immediate objectives keep me occupied every day. I found out that if I inform you about my imminent plans - everything goes smoothly - otherwise I don\u0027t talk too much about my plans and projects. I need to tell you something about Chicago that everybody knows - namely - it\u0027s a very exciting town - no doubt. Chicago is the center and the heart of the United States. It\u0027s a magnificent, heartland of this country, splendid in many ways - and the envy of the rest of the world - nevertheless - it has a lot of problems which change every months and for sure - every season - as the old ones are solved - the new ones - appear. That\u0027s how everything works. Presently - the Chicago\u0027s mayor decided to combine quite a few of severely underutilized grade schools since nobody would touch the mostly - awful - high schools with a \"ten foot pole\" due to their rich infested with all kinds of vicious, young hoodlums of various colors, backgrounds and other \"persuasions\". That\u0027s not to say that Chicago doesn\u0027t have a lot of excellent public schools - the so called \"magnet\" schools or charter schools which show good results. The public schools\u0027 teachers union has been behaving in an awfully abrasive and nasty manner. They don\u0027t produce anything tangible; they don\u0027t show any profits - on the contrary - their evaluations are lousy - so they shouldn\u0027t bleed the property owners and other taxpayers for more and more money for public schools. The place for the employees unions belongs in the companies who produce goods while they show profits. When the companies show gains - they need to support the employees\u0027 unions and to share their gains with the people who work for them. However we all know well - that the minute the wide global competition - closes the facilities down - they let all their employees go - union or non-union. The workers have to find other things to do. That\u0027s the way it goes now in 2013 when the global trade and international business makes all the prominent nations trade with each other on a big scale - thus most countries are vulnerable to each others\u0027 important internal events. The teachers\u0027 union and their long term members fight for the \"steady\", guaranteed incomes. Their president gets a salary close to a third of a million dollars per year - in addition to that - they blatantly draw their bloated retirement pensions which squeeze the taxpayers\u0027 - dry - in Chicago - and continue to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars per day - extra - which runs the deficit budgets - more into the dangerous - red, negative balance - territory. Not only the politicians don\u0027t do anything about it - to the contrary - they don\u0027t give a hoot about most of their - hard working, middle or low income - constituents -while - the rich, Chicago teachers\u0027 union is calling everybody who tries to talk some bloated budget sense into them - \"racists\" and \"bandits\" who do not care about Chicago\u0027s poor children. So why doesn\u0027t the union president work for free for those children instead of enjoying a third of a million dollars in salary which bleeds the Chicago property owners and various other taxpayers? In addition - Chicago Public Schools Systems are an abominable union \"close\" shop - which means that whoever starts teaching in Chicago public schools - immediately pays a large chunk of their salary to the union which does almost nothing to protect the outstanding probationary teachers while they have to support a lot of the semi-competent the so called tenure track teachers - the \"lifers\" - who should be doing something else - other than teaching the youngsters. The first year contracts for Chicago teachers are enormous since the general public foots the bill. This situation plus their bloated, underfunded pensions - are pounded upon every day by all the local media - which just makes your proverbial \"skin crawl\" - big time. Other stuff going on this summer 2013 - the Chicago Black Hawks - the hockey team - just won the Stanley Cup. It\u0027s not that I and a lot of other people in Chicago give the \"rat\u0027s ass\" about hockey or other sports - but tons of other Chicago-ans are happy, going wild - however - some of those \"enthusiasts\" - vandalize the businesses as well as the private property owners located close to those huge sports\u0027 venues. After they had their \"ticker parade\" downtown which usually creates a nightmare to get through Michigan Avenue - just like when President Obama comes to Chicago - I know that all this stuff will quiet down. All this \"hoopla\" will pass quickly the glorious summer of 2013 can resume with tons of free concerts and other \"freebies\" paid for - only partially by the Chicago taxpayers but - mostly - by rich corporations - so far - so good. Hopefully - the last of the huge summer parades - are finished; while the gay pride parade took place at the beginning of the summer - and thank God this year it was not - a disgusting and revolting event - as it can be - at times. It\u0027s not that anybody dislikes the gay people who show some civility and good taste or anything like that. The heterosexuals who publicly display a lot of ugly, exhibitionist, extremely loud actions - also make our \"skins crawl\". In addition - we don\u0027t like to be called \"homophobes\" each time we criticize some gay excesses. The constructive criticism is always useful and effective. Around the middle of August - I - usually - get sick of the summer - especially if it\u0027s a horribly hot, humid and full of awfully long heat waves like the summer of 2012. At any rate - I love the fall season and the beginning of winter is also fun - if it\u0027s not a fierce winter - like they frequently happen - in Chicago. I noticed that after I am in Chicago for several years - all the city\u0027s numerous issues start getting on my nerves and I long for the beautiful, mountainous Pittsburgh - which is quite a bit warmer in the winter - than Chicago - with Pittsburgh\u0027s - pretty, hilly Squirrel Hill - a beautiful part of town where our family has always lived - starts to look good to me. After I am in Pittsburgh for several years - their West Virginia, poker faced hillbillies and other numerous idiot acting elements - start to bother me there - big time and I start missing the international, gorgeous Chicago. I am seriously thinking about going to Vancouver, B.C. for a part of the year - preferably during the Chicago\u0027s fierce winter. Vancouver, B.C. has a paradise on earth - moderate winters. I also noticed that while I visited you in Israel - everything in Israel feels right to me as if I belong there; however - I can\u0027t stand Israel\u0027s long, hot, never ending - summers. You commented many times - that even though you have always loved Israel and lived there almost all your life - tons of stuff constantly going on there - gets on your nerves - a lot - as well. Then you added something which I will never forget - \"No matter what - Israel is where we belong - it\u0027s our country and we love since it\u0027s our homeland.\" I would love to live in Israel for a part of the year or - at least - to spend the fierce Chicago winters there - Israel feels like a paradise on earth during December, January, February and March - while Chicago during those winter months - is usually immersed in cruel single digit temps with the snow crystals and the famous Chicago wind - beating fiercely over the Chicagoans praying fervently for the spring - to finally arrive - always followed by the glorious Chicago summers - with the gentle breeze flowing from Lake Michigan into the vast parks by the glorious Lake Michigan. The Fourth of July came and went - this year the Navy Pier Park - which usually shoots the most glorious displays - during the summer 2013 - shot only eleven minutes of puny fireworks. Last summer they displayed a half an hour of gorgeous fireworks - in a triple digit heat. Thank God this summer continues mostly cool and splendid - so far. On the eve of The Fourth - lots of places shoot the fireworks around Chicago. As you know I still live in the northern suburbs which start to get on my nerves since I like the city of Chicago - especially the enormous parks close to the Lake Michigan which is where I usually live when I live in the city - so almost every day I go for an early morning walk along the special walking path close to the silvery blue - Lake Michigan. The suburbs shot nice fireworks which I could see through my window; the displays ran short - not like some summers when they go crazy with the noise - all night. They were a lot of fun to watch. My friends and I are going out dancing this weekend. The new ballroom studios constantly open and close around Chicago. Some of the nicest studios are located in the Loop/Downtown - however during the summers when the center of Chicago is full of tourists from everywhere - the downtown Chicago at night is not the safest place to roam with all the petty and big hoodlums on the loose. One always has to be careful and streetwise when moving around town since during this summer 2013 - as every summer - tons of happy tourists descend on Chicago - as every summer. It\u0027s nice when they come - but it\u0027s even better when go back where they came from around Labor Day holiday. This city likes to show off and has tons of every imaginable exciting stuff to present to the visitors - but enough is enough - in addition to being a great thing for the city - this huge influx of the summer visitors - also creates some problems. Chapter 2 My Dearest Tina, The summer is zooming by fast and we are having tons of fun while the world - in general - is ready to explode for various reasons in various dangerous spots which the mass media \"pounces\" upon - every hour on the news. Nevertheless - I made a firm resolution to keep a positive outlook on life and not to associate, pay attention to or deal in any manner with any noisy, negative, mean spirited, ugly individuals of any kind. They - permanently - stay out of my way and out of my family and true friends\u0027 way - as well. Every new day is a new beginning for me now - I appreciate all the good things - the little ones and the big ones - finally happening in my life. I thank God every day for all the opportunities I get in my life - finally. Of course - I vigorously \"dig\" in every direction so my goals are always in focus. It\u0027s not easy to be successful - but failure is not an option for me and other people whom I admire. This year - summer 2013 - they shot short and puny fireworks displays from Navy Pier in spite of super good weather while last year - Navy Pier had half hour of superb fireworks - in triple digit heat. Last night I was out with my long term friend - Alina - who got on my nerves quite a bit - as if my earlier resolve to distance myself from the people I have known for a long time - but who frequently get on my nerves - holds firm - so far. She always likes to talk about the same stuff - how our lives were totally different when we lived in Eastern Europe. I always look ahead into the near future - as well as further - down the road - so her endless speeches about the past - which I heard many times - get on my nerves a lot. It\u0027s good to keep a \"poker face\" when anybody gets on my nerves and when I watch all the colorful, typical to Chicago - types and some of them look - awful; they don\u0027t need to read my face. It\u0027s always good to keep a \"poker face\" - just in case. It\u0027s a big town full of all the imaginable kinds of people but what\u0027s interesting is that - the most famous and exciting celebrities from the U.S. and other famous countries - can\u0027t stay away from this city. Because of that - one needs to be streetwise at all times - a big city like this one always attracts a lot of crazy elements. Anybody moving freely around a big town like Chicago - needs to be careful and always a few steps - ahead. I told you that I love Chicago during the summers - when the city - glows with fun and excitement - however - as always - one has to be careful, streetwise and constantly think quickly - on your feet. It\u0027s a big town - full of tourists - up and down the glorious Michigan Avenue. At the beginning of the summer it\u0027s fun to look at them - however - towards the end of the summer season - it\u0027s nice when the kids go back to school and all the tourists go back where they came from after they spent their money in the city. They publish a lot of exciting magazines in Chicago and since the publishers want to attract the younger readership for their ad revenues - their printed stuff is exciting even if it borders at times on a slight porno - while still being tastefully erotic. Some Polish and Russian young publishers the so called \"young Turks\" since they are brash and determined - do an outstanding job in terms of distributing a lot of local and international printing materials of excellent quality - which are free to the readers. Hey, Tina - this coming week is important because I have made almost all the arrangements for a smooth and quick - move back into the city. The suburbs might be good for families with the school aged kids but for a \"city slicker\" like me - used to the exciting hum of a big city - the suburbs feel dull like living in a congested small town with their familiar, \"small town\" idiots encountered too frequently - in a grocery store and other places. That gets on my nerves a lot since I don\u0027t like to look at various losers and half-idiots. It\u0027s useful not to focus on them more than absolutely necessary and not to make any disapproving faces since they shouldn\u0027t know what I\u0027m thinking when they glance at my \"poker face\". Its more useful and productive to smile and pay attention - almost exclusively - to successful and attractive people of all ages - while I only glance over some idiots\u0027 faces. I love to live in a center of Chicago - close to the lake - where the summer parade of all kinds of tourists and other interesting human types - pass me every morning when I walk along the Lake Michigan shore/park - it\u0027s exciting to observe various types from all over this country and abroad who come to visit Chicago every summer. I also love to watch the foreigners making big asses of themselves as they walk down - totally magnificent Michigan Avenue and copiously take photos with their phone cameras. The Japanese tourists - normally - appear very precise, happy and eager to record everything they see in Chicago. Of course - you know that Chicago is full of Poles - tons of them are crawling around Chicago - and for the most part - they are good people. Here - they are in the United States - it\u0027s not \"their\" Poland where they can be free with their numerous national hostilities and prejudices. Needless to say - a lot of Polish people visit Chicago from Poland every summer - most of them speak decent English and behave in the same manner while they are in the United States. Tomorrow - the heat wave will break. Unlike the last tortuously hot summer - this summer\u0027s the heat waves are short. I - presently - live very close to the gloriously silvery blue Lake Michigan which blows a pleasant breeze towards beautiful Chicago shores/parks - all summer - so I walk by the lake almost every morning. I told you before that Chicago is gorgeously - gorgeous during the summer. In the winter - it\u0027s an altogether a different story with the fierce, famous Chicago wind blowing mercilessly from the lake. Did I ever tell you that I have this \"elbow\" theory regarding negotiating the busy places of Chicago in the rush hours or when I plow though a dense human concentration? When I take the public transportation which is necessary in a big city - some of those types riding the public transportation will - most definitely make your skin crawl - big time for a lot of reasons so it\u0027s very important to keep a proverbial \"poker face\" since you absolutely can\u0027t make various faces of disgust in front of them. If I feel that too many people are in my personal space - I skillfully use my arms and elbows around. It\u0027s all done inconspicuously - so anybody getting too close into my personal space - will \"accidentally\" get jabbed by my elbows after which I will say \"excuse me\" and smile a non-committal, \"poker face\" half a smile. This is one of the nicest summers which I can recall - lots of fun - in additon - tons of important things of all kinds happen to me this summer - while I make damn sure - they continue to happen in that quick and effective mode. I am very happy with Milochka\u0027s recent change of behavior. She straightened out her screwy habits so we can be friends again. Not that I am not glad that things turned out that way with her - but she is not nearly as important to me as she was in the past. Some people like she - have a lot of good qualities and a few - seemingly - big shortcomings which - as it turns out - can be easily eliminated. I told you before that I hate it when all the national and international celebrities - come to Chicago looking for validation and love from all the local media plus all the people here. If they are that talented and great - why don\u0027t they find the cure for cancer or some other terrible calamity inflicting people? Last night my friend Ellen and I went to watch various people and little children dancing at the enormously popular Summer Dance Series - generously sponsored by the city of Chicago and held outside on a big dance floor at the lush Grant Park. The live band always plays for the dancers of different ages, skill levels and backgrounds. I like this Sunday ballroom dance event the most - because it takes place early in the day - also the ballroom variety of dancing is my favorite. Ellen is a good, solid person - a new friend - whom I have known for several years but only last summer we started to get closer during the last year\u0027s yearly Summer Dance Sundays. She is tall, masculine and plain looking even though she is not a lesbian. If I saw her more than once per week - her slight Louisiana \"drawl\" manner of speaking English would get on my nerves but she is well educated - so her affected speech is less irritating to me and also - I got used to it. I respect her since she is sharp, streetwise and quick on her feet - to think logically. A famous African American leader - local to Chicago - Rev. Jessie Jackson - also speaks in that Louisiana \"drawl\" manner which makes it easy for the comedians to make fun of him. Ellen is smart and shrewd and I always respect those attributes - still if I saw her more than once per week - she would get on my nerves - you know me. I like to be surrounded by male and female friends who are successful, elegant, attractive and full of savoir vivre - but while I constantly look for new, accomplished individuals - I try not to neglect my old friends whom I got to know well over the years with all their good and bad qualities which - at times - so I non-commitally - attempt to \"straighten up a bit\". Things always change for the better for me - since I never stop looking for more advatangeous situations of every kind; since everything constantly shifts and moves up for me - just like a quick, daily toss of a colorful kaleidoscope. My important goals - which change into a reality - so the new goals constantly begin - makes the process which keeps my energies focused well. The daily flow of my life - continues. Chapter 3 Hello my most favorite oldest sister, It\u0027s August now - so in another month the summer will be ending and the fall wind\u0027s smell will come towards the end of August. As much as I like the summer fun in Chicago - I can\u0027t wait for the autumn which has always been my most favorite season. I start waiting for the fall - towards the end of every summer. It was very windy the last few days - so walking close to the lake - was bothersome - thus I had to walk a little farther from the Lake Michigan - in the park - adjacent to the lake. The Chicago city planners constantly do a magnificent job of making huge and small parks - as close to the lake as humanly - possible. Today, tomorrow and Sunday - the winds should quiet down - enabling me walking right next to the lake - which is always not only fun but I get a dose of fresh, morning energy after looking for the color of the lake which changes almost every morning. The Lake Michigan has a slightly different color almost every day. Some mornings it appears more blue while other days it glows with more green. Yulitchka is getting ready to visit Chicago. She can\u0027t wait. Remember when you visited here the first time? You loved everything a lot - then you got used to the city and all its beauty. When you first got to Chicago - you never had enough of driving along the Lake Shore Drive and watching the magnificent Lake Michigan side of the city\u0027s skyline during the day and at night. Then you got used to all this beauty and didn\u0027t even notice it. After all - Yulitchka and her family has been living in a beautiful Vancouver, B.C for the last ten years. When I first visited Vancouver last year - I found it just as breathtaking as Chicago. I know that she will be comparing Chicago to Vancouver which is by no means any \"chopped liver\" big city - as compared to Chicago - a famous international center of global and all American - grandeur. Chicago has always had tons of foreigners from many different countries constantly living and working here. They - normally - stay here for a while - sometimes longer - while they - normally - dream about returning to their home country. Nevertheless the foreigners - usually - become naturalized Americans - especially after they start working here if they have salable skills thus they contribute tons to a high standard of living in the U.S. The Americans who were born here in the U.S. - frequently - outwardly - appreciate all the vast contributions done by us - the naturalized Americans - however - frequently - during the economical downturns - the U.S. develops the underlying current of the hostility towards the foreigners; the last few years - while the U.S. and the rest of the world has been suffering the economic lack of growth - the underlying currents of undeserved resentments towards the naturalized Americans - became quite obvious - one can \"cut those with the knife\". Those idiotic trends come and go and they usually coincide with the economic trends in the U.S. economy. Most of the Nobel prizes won for the U.S. - which improve the standard of living for this country - are won by the naturalized Americans which means - foreigners - and the Jews - but instead of appreciating that fact - the Americans - born here - the so called \"Wasps\" - which consider themselves the elite - the white anglosaxon protestants - the presumed - top layer - frequently \"snicker down their noses\" on the foreigners and call them all kinds of derogatory names especially when slightly drunk - among their own bodies - in their posh private clubs where they can feel better than anybody else - for a short moment. If they are smart they know very well - that they can only indulge in that kind of stupid behavior - occasionally - or they will come under heavy scrutiny and they will be \"hosed\" down with the same kind of criticism - they themselves - like to dole out to other people - when given an opportunity. Tina - I can remember a lot of happy summers in Europe when we were little - that is - you were always a teenager when I was still a child. One of the happiest summers - all of us spent in a gloriously beautiful Polish mountain resort nestled at the feet of Polish mountains which which had pretty rose bushes of different colors in front of each clean summer villas - rented out to us by the locals families - when we - the families of big cities\u0027 dwellers would come to spend a few summer months there - while the rightful owners of those villas - moved into crowded quarters of their relatives or close friends - for the summers while they rented out their villas to us. We all dressed up in fancy clothes and went to the gorgeous park full of beautiful flowers - where the orchestra played magnificent tunes and the life was great and simple. Sometimes it seems as if it was a long time ago - but at times - it feels - like yesterday. However - I much prefer to focus on today and tomorrow. This coming weekend the weather should be nice - I have some super good plans for the coming weekend. Last week I went to the very exciting lecture downtown Chicago early in the morning. The international organization served a super good breakfast - of various fruits (beautifully arranged), coffee, fresh bagels plus selection of cheeses. The woman lecturer - appeared extremely knowledgeable about the international politics - with her specialty - Iran. She spoke \"to the point\" - didn\u0027t get sidetracked with \"personal stories\" - in short - she was an excellent speaker. The only problem with that lecture - in my opinion - arises from the guest lecturer being a part of their staff from New York City - instead of getting an outside speaker. Nevertheless - it was a good lecture where I - easily - have made several good contacts - for my lectures - since that organization has a lot of members - on the level; they are well educated, well connected, fashionably groomed and fun to be around - my kind of people. Chapter 4 Hello Tina, my favorite oldest sister, I told you that things happen for a reason in my life while a lot of events are meant to happen as if certain things \"want\" to happen - no matter what I decide. Each summer reminds me of various loves of my life. Remember when after I divorced Jack - quite a few years ago - I was madly in love with Roberto - for a while - mainly during that one summer which was - probably - one of the most beautiful summers of my life. It was a great time of my life - but it was also a very bad time for me - as well. I became too dependent on every little move this youngster expressed towards me - his smile could make me soar but each time he frowned at me - my whole day was ruined. I didn\u0027t like this situation but I couldn\u0027t free myself for a while - as if some evil magician cast a bad spell on me. I knew that there are ways to reverse that magic. At the beginning of our friendship - I was very relaxed around Roberto who seemed perceptive and sensitive in spite of his young age. He appeared a close and good friend at first - since he was - frequently - making me laugh. He looks - gorgeously gorgeous but he is always modest about his great looks. He seems focused and goal oriented as well as being intelligent and quite streetwise - having gone through some hard times during his childhood in Durango, Mexico. I liked to listen about his life and his childhood - and after he also mentioned - at length - several of his ex-girlfriends - I thought that we will always be easy friends. I am not sure how and why this feeling of casual and comfortable friendship changed to an obsessive preoccupation and constant thoughts about him - where he was - with whom - what he was doing while the images of him making love to some young girl his age - started to hurt me in an almost physical way. I knew that I had to free myself from this suddenly powerful - bond to Roberto which gave me some big highs - when I looked at his smiling face with his brown eyes narrowing but my longing to hear the sound of his voice on the phone or to look at him - even for a moment - felt awful to me - since I like to make my own decisions and to call my own shots. I couldn\u0027t talk to you about it since - at that time you were also involved heavily with your husband\u0027s best friend. Your sons were furious with you and our father worried that it will break your marriage which - thank God - didn\u0027t happen. At least - I was already divorced when I got involved with Roberto. \"I don\u0027t know how and what happened when everything changed so much between us in such a short time,\" I was trying to explain my confusion to our big brother Max who - supposedly - knows everything there is to know about the relationships between men and women - but by the time he was thirty - as you know - he was already married for the second time and his second marriage was \"on the rocks\" for a long time. \"I am sure - he noticed that immediately\", Max always likes to lecture me about men and other things, \"When he starts talking about any money you got from Jack - you need to dump him right away and in general - if he doesn\u0027t treat you right - show him the door. There is more where he came from - for a beautiful woman like you.\" I fervently wished - at that time while I was obsessed with Roberto - that I could be that blaze about everything - especially about men. However - it was obvious to me that I needed to dump Roberto and find me some other interesting, new energies for my life since my new, free lifestyle - at first - appeared scary to me. After all I was a happy part of \"Jack and Maggie\" team for a long time so - it was frightening - suddenly - to be in a group of women looking for a man - the same group on which I used to snicker down my nose when I was happily married to a great guy, like Jack whom almost every woman - wanted. I needed to adjust to being me - on my own - and feel good about myself. The thoughts of getting rid of Roberto out of my life or at least - attempts to put him \"on the back burner\" the way Max suggested - terrified me at that time - not that I didn\u0027t try. I didn\u0027t know then - as much as I know now - about various effective ways to keep the men or other exciting but addictive - elements - on the \"back burners of my life\" while I glow with some other various lasting, positive - energies. * * * After several months of me waiting literally \"on pins and needles\" - for Roberto\u0027s calls so I could always initiate our next meeting - like going out to dinner - while he - clearly - enjoyed his steady upper hand - I realized that I needed to stop seeing him - I needed to stop all the contacts with him since he became like an addiction. \"Hey - Max - I need to dump this little shit - he thinks - he has me where he wants me.\" Our older brother Max always loves to be our adviser. \"Just call him up and tell him that you are not interested in friendship with him - since you met a middle aged man - on your level - so this thing with him would interfere with it. Keep it short, simple and stick to your guns but don\u0027t be bitchy or anything like that.\" \"You have a lot of experience in that area.\" \"I - usually - do the dumping - but not always\", he added modestly. \"Yeah, right. With your Napoleonic complex - I can\u0027t imagine anybody dumping you.\" A few days later - I was talking to Roberto on the phone in a semi-casual manner and when he asked me if we could get together I \"seized the moment\". \"I think that - from now on - we need to be \u0027just friends\u0027 for a while. You can call me sometimes if you want to talk to me - but I am - currently - kind of busy with other - things in my life so this \u0027friendship\u0027 with you would interfere with my lifestyle,\" I couldn\u0027t believe how casually my voice sounded even though I was trembling inside. There was a silence for a long moment. \"I understand. You need some space - I never stand in your way - I told you so before. If you need anything - call me.\" \"Okay. Thanks.\" After he hang up I felt - for a short time - as if a part of my heart died - but I knew that I did the right thing. You know me - once I shut some doors behind me - I plow ahead even if it hurts a lot for a while; I know that things get better. They always do. * * * It was a hard year but some days were better than others - the year went by. I missed Roberto and thought about him frequently. It was good to be with other people so I started to go to several Chicago\u0027s ballroom dancing studios which was a great thing to do - I also got more involved with Israel - that is - I was reading the Jerusalem Post weekly and watched for any international news from Israel. Some days were easier than others but after a year - everything got better. It always does. Right now - things are - finally - going really well for me - in every area of my life. All the major storms are behind me. I am involved in some some exciting projects - as you know. After my novel got published and it sells good on Amazon.com - I can lecture in various venues around Chicago. Of course - I make sure that my series of lectures are super exciting for the public. In addition - for the first time in my life something really good and well deserved finally happens to me - namely - I set my own fees which I keep fair and reasonable for the public - as compared to other lecturers around Chicago. Remember when I used to relate to you in more detail than you ever wanted or needed to hear - how my supervisors - frequently - picked on me for various reasons. Now - they can all - first - \"go fly a kite\" then \"jump in the lake\" - I don\u0027t need them anymore. It\u0027s a good feeling but it\u0027s even though it\u0027s an arduous way - to get there. One has to work hard, work honestly and have a clear, positive goals and a good vision for himself or herself. It\u0027s not that hard - people do it every day. I don\u0027t get discouraged - easily or for a long time - once I set out to do something. My most current project is to deliver my yearly/one per month - series of lectures in various press clubs and other clubs in Chicago - which means that I am lecturing to a group of journalists - many of them with Pulitzer prizes to their names. Sometimes it\u0027s hard to keep the confidence - up - but I can - usually - hold my own - even among the people who try to \"impress\" me - or at times - to intimidate me. One has to practice the self-confidence - a little bit - each day. It\u0027s not such a big deal to get good at it. Yesterday I went to a lecture in a prestigious press club in Chicago and the lecturer - a prominent local journalist with a prestigious Pulitzer to his name - delivered a boring, tedious and self-congratulatory \"drivel\" which was way too long. Needless to say - your little sister - seized the opportune moment to - tactfully - get the hell out of there - but not before I made all the necessary contacts - to enhance and effectively promote - my series of lectures which are exciting, informative and a lot shorter than - his - one hour and a half of boring, empty and needlessly - self - centered - \"drivel\". Of course - my all time idol has always been a famous, \"muck-cracking\" Chicago journalist named Mike Royko - who passed away a while ago. This legendary commentator on Chicago politics - wrote a super book titled \"The Boss\" which shines a great light on the political dynasty of Chicago mayors - Richard Daley, his father, his brothers, their sons. However - when I tried to read his daily column in Chicago Sun Times where he worked before he started with Chicago Tribune - it seemed slightly boring to me. I guess it\u0027s hard to come up with some interesting stuff - every single day. Nevertheless - Mike Royko is a lasting legend among Chicago\u0027s journalists - while - needless to say - the \"Royal\" Dynasty of the Mayor Daley\u0027s political family - eternally despises him and his book - for exposing their political grip on power in Chicago which lasts till today - but thank God - in watered down - version. Chapter 5 My Dearest Tina, The summer of 2013 is ending and even though it was cool and beautiful - in every way - I want to \"get rid\" of it so the glorious fall season - always my favorite - will arrive. Every year the fall goes too fast - and the fierce Chicago winter - starts \"ruling\" the city. This winter - I will re-arrange my lecturing schedule so I can spend January and half of February - in Vancouver, B.C. which has a mild, lovely winter. Hey Tina - remember Lizotchka - my close friend from the time we were little who usually went with us on summer vacations? She has lived in Toronto, Canada for a long time with her husband and grown kids. I have not seen her for a few years - even though we correspond weekly via E-mail. She will be coming to Chicago with her husband - I can\u0027t wait. I have not seen her for six years - only on the snapshots where she looks good - as always. Yesterday as I walked along the beautiful beachfront of Lake Michigan - I listened to NPR - National Public Radio (smart journalists) - the essay of a young American college student impressed me as she related her travel experiences during her journey to the south American country - Costa Rica. She looked to the keys to happiness and she found it in a tiny house of a poor, large Costa Rican family. Then she quoted Aristotle who stated that \"happiness if an inward journey\" - after that she quoted English poet Robert Blake who said -\"in order to be happy - you need something to love, something to do and something to wait for/hope for.\" Tina - you know how much I hate the heat and excessive humidity - however - several days this week will be like that - so I am bracing myself. Of course it\u0027s usually cooler close to the Lake Michigan beaches - but I have things to do - so I need to take my morning walk - early - before it gets hot and humid. Its nice that this summer the nasty hot and humid days don\u0027t last more than a short \"spat\" of one or two days - than it cools off. Today will be a busy day which - thank God didn\u0027t turn out to be as unbearable as they predicted. I need to do a lot of important errands while it\u0027s cool - details tomorrow. I just got up - it\u0027s very early - the day is trying to break - and I simply love this early time during the very beginning of the day. The energies are fresh and clean. It\u0027s still dark outside - since the day is getting a lot shorter than at the beginning of summer - but when the first light of the day breaks in - that\u0027s when all the new energies feel good. Today is Friday and I have always liked Fridays since over the weekend - I do different stuff than during the week. Since its almost the end of August - the tourists are gone so Michigan Avenue is back to normal. I told you that fall is my most favorite season and it always goes to fast - but the most important is that the summer is almost gone. Its a good thing that fall is coming soon - even if this summer was very nice - the cool side - my kind of summer. A week from today - it will already be middle of September so all the Christmas promotions will start - big time - since as you know - every year - the stores start their Christmas campaigns - earlier and earlier. I should be leaving Chicago right before the New Year - to come back in the middle of February. Hey Vancouver, B.C. - open your gates for me since you are a \"paradise\" on Earth during the winter month. Our cousin, Yulitchka - is happy that I will spend the winters in Vancouver, B.C. As I mentioned to you earlier - when I visited her before - after not seeing her a long time - I had a great time with her children (our second cousins) and their kids. It\u0027s very good to have a place to escape the famous Chicago winters which can be awfully cold, with a fierce wind - making for super nasty winter conditions. Only in Chicago and a few other places close to big lakes. * * * Dearest Tina, The Labor Day passed - marked a beginning of autumn season - great - the fall is coming soon. You probably know well that at this point - every year - I start counting days until the fall arrives since long summers get on my nerves - especially if they are unusually hot. This summer 2013 was glorious - still - it\u0027s nice that it ends. I need to tell you about the end of the summer - quite a few years back when I was a teenager and you were just getting out of your stint in the Israeli army. That summer we still lived in Poland waiting to get the hell out and come to the United States. Even though our lives in Poland were good - still I dreamt of getting the hell out of there. I picked up three volumes of \"Gone with the Wind\" nicely translated into Polish - that summer - as I glanced over the books in our friends\u0027 small library. I looked the volumes over - started to read about Margaret Mitchell\u0027s life which got cut short due to a \"freak\" accident which killed her when she was only like forty three years old and newly - a famous international celebrity who herself looked like a movie star. I remembered seeing the short clips from the 1939 Oscar ceremony in which \"Gone with the Wind\" movie took many, many well deserved Oscars. The movie rights were bought by David Selznick for the unheard of before - price - of fifty thousand dollars and when they finally started the production - all kinds of extra-ordinary stuff was happening all the time during the time of the filming. David Selznick hired and fired the directors while Vivian Leigh\u0027s life - who played Scarlett O\u0027Hara - also underwent a lot of important changes. That memorable summer when I was an older teenager - ready to graduate from high school in Poland and maybe complete my first year at the University of Warsaw - before coming to the United States - my life totally changed after reading a thousand pages of Margaret Mitchell\u0027s - absolute masterpiece - \"Gone with the Wind\" - in an almost non-stop manner. I strongly decided to become a writer/journalist and write just Margaret Mitchell - so the reader gets totally absorbed and involved in the story - to the point that they can\u0027t wait to get back to the book or the article. You know Tina, sometimes I think that in some ways - some events in my life - will happen - no matter what I decide. It can be awesome - I love when it happens even if it\u0027s a little scary - at times. After I read - almost non-stop - the three volumes of \"Gone with the Wind\" that memorable summer - I carried each volume with me for a long time - like something I loved and didn\u0027t want to part with. It\u0027s a great high for a writer when the reader wants to carry their book with them - then keeps coming back to the story - as both lives change - the writer\u0027s and the reader\u0027s. Some summers are defining and important to me - even though - as I mentioned to you many times - I really love the fall with the leaves changing colors, mild weather and the promise in the air of fun winter with the star holiday - the New Year\u0027s Eve coming up before long. * * * It\u0027s almost fall in Chicago. Tina, the weather is glorious. Yesterday I went to visit my old friend, Ruth. She is getting to be a very old lady which I didn\u0027t notice before since she used to look - at least - twenty years younger than her real age. Last year - however - she started to loose a lot of weight off her slim frame. In another words - she started to show her real age so now she is home - rarely goes outside - only if her friends and family take her for a walk. She is very lucky that she can have some helpers so she can live at home - instead of - \"crawling around\" in some nursing home where the crew - normally - don\u0027t give a \"hoot\" - even if the facility is expensive. I told you before - Tina that I have been friends with her younger cousin - the one who speak with the her Louisiana drawl accent - which - sounds phony to me and it started to get on my nerves more than ever. This summer she added additional irritants to her personality - namely - she developed various, new summer skin sensitivities that give her an excuse not to wash her body thoroughly which gives her a body odor or B.O. which I noticed a lot more this summer than during the last year. I know that last summer which was an awfully hot one - she - evidently - washed her body - more - than this last summer of 2013 - a much cooler one. That and her Loiusiana drawl/accent started to work my nerves - big time - when on occasions - when we would attend the outside park concerts together - I would start to smell her unwashed body since she sits next to me. One time this summer - I decided to try an \"opaque/oblique\" approach - to improve her personal hygiene - a bit. I broached the subject lightly by saying that \"some people don\u0027t even take a simple sponge bath during the hot days of summer - so they smell\". She started to sniff - her underarms until - she got the hint. Tina, I wish you could see the expression on her face - it looked really funny. You know me - while I don\u0027t like to be rude to people - I find an effective way to communicate what needs to be said. At any rate - her constant excuses regarding her vaious \"sensitivities\" and \"allergies\" also got on my nerves a lot; she thinks that all that - gives her an excuse to not to clean her house properly - which also smells like dirt - so I am told since I always find an effective excuse for not visiting her at home - especially during the hot summer days. * * * Lately I have been spending some time with my new friend - Julie. She seems to have a lot of nice qualities which I appreciate - however the fact that her new car is always messy inside - tells me something about her personality. I made a strong decision about meeting new friends who are - outstanding, successful and fun and there are a lot of people like that in Chicago who would like to be friends with me. I told you before that I have a lot of cyber friends with whom I am in contact via the web. It\u0027s amazing how close I can get to some people whom - at first - I don\u0027t know. However as the time goes and we express our various views and opinions on Youtube\u0027s various clips - we get to know each other over the years. It\u0027s a fascinating process in which I made some meaningful friends - but I also lost some - and of course - the new ones always - appear while the old ones - come back. The cyber space is like another version of interesting life/parallel life - it\u0027s very exciting. Yesterday I watched the exciting tennis match by two top femal tennis players - one was an established champion - looking strong, powerful, undefeated like a cross between a big tank and a super mighty animal - her opponent appeared a lot smaller, slimmer - a lot more human. I always pull for the underdog. It was amazing to see the strength coming out of the plays of the slimmer player. The slim \"underdog\" really gave the established champion a big \"run for her money\" - notwithstanding the lady champ\u0027s gigantic, muscular physique - she appeared like a huge, muscular gorilla/tank. It was a good game which showed a lot of promise for a slender but strong - opponent. You know what they say Tina - in order to beat the champ - you have to really \"destroy\" them. The sportsmanship always amazes me - right after the contestants fight - fiercely - at the end of the game - they hug each other. Awesome. This phenomenon should happen a lot more in real life. I have the theory regarding the pay backs. Our family supports it as you well know. We believe that after we always need to \"even out the score\" in some way - first - but after that - we can be friends with our ex-opponents. After all - the likes and dislikes are the opposite sides of the same coin - and one can follow another - soon. At the moment - I can honestly admit to you that I dislike most of my \"old\" friends but I know that it will change. I don\u0027t like to abandon my old friends - unless they \"cross me\". Milochka - for some mysterious reason - doesn\u0027t get on my nerves - nearly as much as my other friends - get on my nerves at times - for certain - its because Milochka straightened out her \"crooked\" ways - to a large degree. * * * Hey, Tina - did we ever talk about some great times we had during our long chats - while we sipped some red wine which - definitely puts us in a good mood. Needles to say we never overdo the red wine during the winter nights or beer during the breezy summer evenings when the chilled beer tastes heavenly. Nobody wants to drink too much - but some alcohol is a great helper in some tight situation and general fun enhancer when entertaining or closing a lot of fabulously profitable and good for everybody - business deals - the kind the smart people - especially our family members - almost always - accomplish. Chapter 6 My Dearest Tina, The glorious fall is almost here - since in September some single hot days - slip in - but they cool off as soon as the early afternoon comes. Of course since October and most of November are beautiful in Chicago - they go very fast - then - frequently very cold and windy winter - starts dragging forever before the spring finally comes. They start their famous German oriented, October fests in September - so a lot of the \"umpa-umpa\" German bands plays tons of polkas and marches. I can only enjoy that kind of intense crowds - for a short time - but it\u0027s fun to watch people at those festivals. I\u0027m sure that I have mentioned to you about me - absolutely adoring \"Gone with the Wind\" super novel in its printed form and the famous movie. I see the movie every year and never get tired of it. As far as re-reading the novel goes - I have my favorite parts which I love. One of them is the passage in which Scarlett\u0027s and Rhett\u0027s little daughter - Bonnie Blue - has an accident riding her pony. Each time I read it - I cry while I think of life\u0027s unpredictability - however - my take on it - is that - frequently - life is unpredictable in a positive way. You know Tina - how certain pieces of music have always had a great influences on our lives since you, me and many other members of our family have always been in love with various Tango compositions - instrumental arrangements as well as vocals. Various Tangos have influenced our lives a lot. I vividly remember one summer when you visited Chicago during which we did a lot of fun things with Milochka and her brother who drove us around Chicago so you could see the beautiful, \"tourists\" oriented parts of this city. His radio player turned a few times a CD with various arrangements of \"LaCumaprsita\", \"Kiss of Fire\" and a few other Tango classics. That night was the first time you saw Chicago at night with the stars shining on the Lake Michigan and the lights of the Chicago\u0027s - night time skyline\u0027s skyscrapers - sparkle like brilliant diamonds against the black velvet of the finest jewelry display arrangement. * * * Tina, do you remember how the youngsters in Europe loved to ride the motor scooters? They were a lot of fun during the warm spring, summer and fall days. Of course the bad weather always spoiled the rides in the open vehicles. Our older brother Max absolutely adored his tan colored Lambretta scooter and it was a lot of fun for me to ride behind him while he enjoyed himself, his youth, his life. When I studied for one short year at the University of Warsaw - I dated a few good looking guys who owned scooters which were always tons of fun - it\u0027s a shame that in the United States - the cars are the main modes of transportation for the youngsters. I told you that when I get up early - every morning - I like to say a short prayer which always gives me a lot of \"good\" energy for the day ahead. Before falling asleep - it\u0027s also good to spend a short time on meditation - to clear out some negative moments of the day. Finally my life entered a very good stage for which I waited for a long time and worked very hard to achieve it. My projects are excellent and a lot of people - including me - finally - really enjoy them plus that goes together with - all of us - earning - the well deserved - royalties. The last most important factor has finally arrived. We are having a lot of fun while we honestly earn our well deserved - monetary rewards. Life is finally - really great for me - after some typical turbulences so now I know for sure that even though - things are finally really good for us - everything gets progressively better and better and better for me, my family, our true friends and our second, precious homeland - Israel. We always love the U.S - first - her many good people who offered us not only the sanctuary but a real home away from home - our Israel - which we will never forget and will always continue to bless the U.S which means we shall keep contributing in tons of positive ways - to the good lives for a lot of decent Americans and they always appreciate us - the decent naturalized Americans.
